Wholesale energy growth in North America is==20expected to be driven by the continuing deregulation of power markets in th=e=20United States and large-scale energy outsourcing by utilities and large=20energy consumers.  Enron expects to continue to broaden its early lead acro=ss=20the European continent as markets quickly open to competition.

I don=0F t know if it=0F s wishfulthinking, or if the seasons are really beginning to turn from our palesummer into a Bay Area glorious Fall.  It=0F s premature, I know.  A fewfallen leaves, the start of schools, slightly longer afternoon shadows... I=0F m jumping the gun.  I can=0F t wait for this summer to be over,especially this summer.  The pounding never stops, and as I hear the dinof the cash register ringing with each climb in Southwest temperature, Ican barely keep track of all the hiccups which drive prices up: fires inMontana restricting transmission paths, blown up interstate gas pipelinein New Mexico, diminishing N-Ox credits for in-state power plants,depleted inventory of hours of voluntary load interruptions forcommercial and industrial customers, credit limits restricting importsof Canadian power into the Northwest and California, and BPA buyingabout 1,000 MW to cover its short hydro position. I also get the willies every time another politician lambastes theCalifornia restructured power industry.  I just want to end to thesummer, now, and start a two week Fall vacation ... anywhere, even inCleveland.There are seven, count them, seven investigations into some aspect ofthe wholesale power market out here.  Two days ago there were only six,but FERC just added another yesterday in response to the Prez=0F srequest.  That means FERC has two, the PUC has two, the State AttorneysGeneral has two (one on the ISO Governing Board, and one on the in-stategenerators), and one by the Electric Oversight Board.  If you don=0F t havean ongoing study of the California Market, then you=0F re not hip.All of these investigations, save FERC=0F s Section 206 Investigation, aregoing to amount to near nothing.  A lot of wasted time and paper.  ThePUC and EOB studies have their conclusion sections all finished.  Nowthey need some evidence to support their assertions.And how are we holding up under all of this?  How are you doing?  I talkto many of you throughout the week, and I know how frustrated you are.I share your frustration.  You want to tell the public, the press, andanyone in between the truth.  You want to lay out the facts.  You wantto show anyone who will listen that each interference into the market ismaking things worse, not better.  The price caps, for example, aredamnable and screwing up the prices, much to the detriment of thosepeople for who price caps were supposed to be a protection against priceshocks.  Now they are receiving higher average prices.The public isn=0F t going to listen to anything longer than a sound bite.And let=0F s face it, when it comes to stellar public relations, ourindustry is not known for turning in A+ performances, except for SCE.Those guys seem to get their story in front of the public at everyturn.  I heard SCE is putting on their customers=0F  bill, =0F\"Here is whatyou would have paid if the rate freeze ended ....=0F\".  But many of us inthe new power industry, borne from the loins of either the natural-gasindustry or nuclear-power business, learned the hard way that the bestresponse to a public inquiry is a two-block head start in front of anangry mob.  Keep your head down, shut your mouth, and this too shallpass.I don=0F t buy that approach, at least not anymore.  That is, I don=0F tbelieve we have anything to hide, or of which to be ashamed.  Whatelectric restructuring is about is correct, beneficial to the public,and in everyone=0F s best interests.  Look at it this way, when they patthe last shovelful of dirt on your final resting place, for what do youmost want to be remembered?  That you caved in to the political will ofothers, or at a moment when you had the chance, you did what was rightinstead of what was expedient?  I think the choice is easy, albeit lacedwith sheer terror.  Those bland homilies I so diligently teach my kids(e.g., tell the truth, do what is right, think of the big picture andnot just yourself) are a lot easier to speak than to live by.  So joinme and stand up for what you believe.  They can=0F t take away your pride,not yet.Here is this week=0F s line up.>>> Things in the People=0F s Republic of California @@@ Excerpts from FERC=0F s Order on SDG&E Complaint @@@ The Development of a Super-Peak Block Energy Product>>> The Mailbag: A Letter from My Friend, and A Response>>> Odds and Ends (_!_) @@@ Finish the Story Contest @@@ October General Meeting @@@ What Makes Houston, Houston?>>> Things in the People=0F s Republic of California @@@ Excerpts from FERC=0F s Order on SDG&E ComplaintPresident Clinton commented from the Rose Garden that good folks in SanDiego, retired, fixed-income, likely to vote for a Democrat, are makingchoices between buying medicine or air conditioning their homes.  I callthis the Del Monica Beach lecture.  The Prez instructed the FERC toinvestigate the situation in California, and FERC wasted no time.In response to SDG&E=0F s August 2 complaint, whereby the utility askedFERC to impose a $250 price cap on generators in the region, the FERCresponded in a way that I was hoping to see several months ago.  TheFERC slammed SDG&E on their complaint for lack of merit, and the FERCalso initiated an FPA Section 206 Investigation into the wholesale powermarket in California.Here are some of the juicy excerpts from FERC=0F s Order:=0F\"In this order, ... , we are denying SDG&E s requested immediateimposition of a price cap on all sellers in California.  However, we areinstituting consolidated hearing   proceedings pursuant to section 206of the Federal Power Act to investigate the justness and reasonablenessof the rates and charges of public utilities that sell energy andancillary services to or through the California ISO and PX, and to alsoinvestigate whether the tariffs and institutional structures and bylawsof the California ISO and PX are adversely affecting the efficientoperation of competitive wholesale electric power markets in Californiaand need to be modified=0F\"SDG&E concludes that the markets cannot be workably competitive ifsellers are able to exact prices that are considerably above levels thatwould prevail in open competition, i.e., sellers are able to bid andreceive prices significantly above their marginal costs.  SDG&E alsoargues that the hour-to-hour volatility in imbalance energy prices andthe erratic clearing price for ancillary services is an indication thatthe market is breaking down when it is moderately stressed.=0F\"While we find it appropriate to institute a section 206 hearing onthese issues, we cannot implement an immediate price cap of $250/MWh asrequested by SDG&E because there is no record before us to support suchan action.  ...  While the issues raised by this complaint areimportant, the Commission has no basis to conclude that SDG&E s proposalto place an immediate, arbitrary $250/MWh cap on the price that everypublic utility seller of energy and ancillary services may bid into thePX and ISO markets would satisfy this standard.  SDG&E has provided noevidence to demonstrate that all potential sellers are able to exercisemarket power, has not documented a single instance of a sellerexercising market power during times of scarcity, and did not attempt toshow that the conditions underlying the Commission s approval ofmarket-based rates for public utility sellers of energy and ancillaryservices have changed.  Nor did it address specific market orinstitutional  factors that may be causing rates to be unjust orunreasonable.=0F\"SDG&E asserts that the ISO s congestion management and marketstructures are flawed and in need of overhaul. ... Furthermore, SDG&Eexpresses its concern that, for a number of reasons, the congestionmanagement and market reform efforts being pursued by ISO stakeholderswill not produce  meaningful results.  SDG&E indicates that it isprepared to work with the ISO to develop alternative reform proposals;however, SDG&E s complains that the ISO stakeholder process has, inSDG&E s judgment, been ineffective with respect to these issues.=0F\"Various interveners contend that SDG&E s arguments are premature. ...We agree with Interveners. ...  The reform efforts have been the subjectof extensive public review and comment and are nearing completion.Accordingly, we reject SDG&E s arguments at this time.=0F\"It is unclear whether SDG&E s failure to purchase hedging instrumentsfor its retail operations is due to state regulatory policies or itsbusiness decisions.  A retail rate design that exposes consumers to thevolatility of commodity prices would be extraordinary, particularly whenconsumers do not have the ability to receive or respond to pricesignals.=0F\"We are concerned that ... increasing level of market activity in thereal-time market raises significant reliability and economical concerns....  Historically, the ISO procures on a daily basis only the resourcesneeded for the operating day.  Not only does this procurement practiceput pressure on the grid operator to secure needed resources at the lastminute, but the practice is uneconomical.  Such spot-market purchasesare not subject to the ISO s  buyer s cap.  Furthermore, because the ISOis the supplier of last resort for these services, when OOM calls aremade, suppliers realize that the ISO is in a must-buy situation.=0F\"In an effort to address this problem, we direct the ISO to immediatelyinstitute a more forward approach to procuring the resources necessaryto reliably operate the grid.  Specifically, the ISO should anticipatethe need for such additional resources based on  forecasted peakperiods.  We direct the ISO to factor these reforms into an analysis ofthe need for and level of purchase price caps and to include thisanalysis as support for any filing it makes to extend its purchase pricecap authority.=0F\"In closing, WPTF is an intervenor in the case, and we hope to be veryactive in the case through testimony, cross examination, the filing ofbriefs, and reply briefs.>>> Things in the People=0F s Republic of California @@@ The Development of a Super-Peak Block Energy ProductSeveral weeks ago, I discussed with the ISO their interest in developinga new market for a block energy product that would be purchased in themorning of a trade day, and be dispatched during the super-peak hours.I challenged them to let the market participants develop this marketinstead of the ISO doing the same.At the August 1 ISO Governing Board meeting, I stated as the WPTFposition that we oppose price caps, but if the ISO Governing Boardinsisted on going down the $250/MWH price cap route, we would do whatever we could to help the situation and avoid the occurrences of Stage 3alerts.  Whereas I didn=0F t think about the conversation on super-peakblock markets as being relevant to  the remarks before the GoverningBoard, it became painfully clear soon after that we could, and shouldwork with the ISO to develop a new market through either APX or theCalifornia PX, or both, to bring some order to the otherwise chaotic Outof Market system.This week, WPTF and the ISO had a joint meeting whereby both sidesdiscussed the merits of a super-peak block firm-energy product, and howit could be instituted.  The meeting at the ISO, at which WPTF had manyof its members who either have generation in the State, or import powerinto California, was for market participants and the ISO to discuss howto bring more order and price transparency to the ISO s out of marketcalls. The ISO reported that this summer, to date, the amount of moneyspent on Out of Market purchases was about $100 million.  Last year thetotal cost of Out of Market purchases was $1.7 million.APX and CalPX, in response to our earlier discussions with them,presented their proposals at the meeting.  The discussions which ensuedduring the course of the presentations focused on how the ISO mightutilize a product/service to reduce the manpower requirements currentlyneeded to satisfy its out of market telephone calls, typically on shortnotice, and the interest on the part of market participants to make bidsinto either the APX or CalPX s proposed system for a super-peakfirm-energy product.There were no  commitments made by any party, simply a willingness towork together to alleviate the problems associated with findingsufficient electric power during high demand periods with greatertransparency, more participants, and greater market efficiency.We=0F ll keep you posted on our development of this market.>>> The Mailbag: A Letter from My Friend, and A ResponseSometimes I share bites of our Burrito with fellow travellers, much as Idid last week when I sent my friend Mike Florio a copy of the storycalled the Trial of Gow Jing.  Mike sent me a note that I would like toshare. He said I could.  I want you to read it and appreciate that thereare other people who share his view.  I also copied the response I sentto Michael, a.k.a. Old Deuteronomy.Michael wrote:=0F\"I m not going to attempt to complete your little melodrama [theGow-Jing story], but I did want to offer an observation.  In simplertimes, people knew the other people that they did business with, andthey typically lived in the same community.  If a merchant tried tocharge exorbitant prices for his products, even if he was the only onein town who had the product in stock, he would face the wrath of hisfellow citizens.  This undoubtedly served as a constraint on suchbehavior, even in the absence of a CPUC or FERC. Telling Mrs. Jones thatthe loaf of bread she needs to feed her kids will cost her $50 would notbe a pleasant way to do business, and such things ordinarily did nothappen.=0F\"In the modern global economy, of course, this personal aspect of doingbusiness has been almost completely lost.  And so has the restraint.  Ihave no doubt that the folks who sell electricity are good people (jeez,I know many of them), but they work in an environment where the endresults of their business decisions are invisible.  If Mrs. Jones can tafford to run her refrigerator any more, that fact is at best dimlyperceived, and if so it is viewed as cause for some sort of socialprogram, not a reason why a merchant would alter his behavior.=0F\"This is clearly not a case of socialism versus capitalism, because bothscenarios occur within the overall context of a capitalist system.  Butcertainly something fundamental has changed, and not for the better inmy view.  Now everyone feels compelled to squeeze the last dollar out ofevery transaction-- their jobs may even depend upon it-- and no one isresponsible for the end result.  Is this the kind of world we want tolive in???=0F\"PUT THAT IN YOUR BURRITO AND SEE WHAT YOUR READERS SAY!  YOU CAN EVENBLAME ME, SO THAT YOU ARE NOT ACCUSED OF TURNING PINK IN YOUR MIDDLEAGE.      Deut=0F\"Okay.  It=0F s in the Burrito.  And here is what I think.You allude to the change in a world that was once =0F\"more personal=0F\" and= isnow institutional.  You make the point that things are not better off iffor no other reason then the lack of personal accountability.  But Idon=0F t think that in all cases the more personal world is lost.  It isever present, as I will argue below.  Second, your group embraces theimpersonal =0F\"efficiencies=0F\" when it is convenient.  Finally and mostimportantly, where will your social-minded and like minded counterpartsbe when competitive forces leap supply ahead of demand, which mighthappen in a handful of years?However, your essential point is not lost on me.  I do believe thatthere are ways for generators and consumers to be good neighbors inCalifornia.  I have a proposal below to which I would like to hear yourresponse.First, though, the personal business touch is present in our economy.  Iexercise the restraint to which your story pines in many of myconsulting engagements which require financial give and take betweenclient and vendor.  It is simply smart business to do so.  I have beenthe beneficiary of the same with my local bank when errors occurred inmy checking accounts, or when loan payments were made absent mindedlylate, etc., and the late fee forgiven.  However, much of our economy,and certainly the trade of a commodity such as electricity requires theuse of markets.  Nameless and faceless, they do squeeze out all theefficiencies which lead to lower prices, more innovation, and a sharingof price risk with parties who are neither the ultimate consumer nor theinitial producer.  The producer and consumer get out of the riskarbitrage and leave it to others who are more skilled and monied.I find it ironic that TURN, then, is so insistent on arguing, as it hasdone on many many occasions for the relaxation of market separation inthe ISO=0F s congestion management reform.  Elimination of marketseparation is nothing more than the impersonal forcing of parties toexecute trades on either side of a congested transmission path in thename of market efficiency.  Lower prices for consumers.  Does it reallymatter if it is done through person to person transactions, or throughmarkets?Third, your story can be used to make an alternative point.  Whathappens to the merchant in town when Wal-Mart moves into the next towndown the road?  All the faithful customers that your Merchant ofVengeance was protecting suddenly migrate to a competitor with greaterinventory, more choice, and lower prices.  What do you say, then?  Thecorollary for us is direct.  The new generation owners moved literallybillions of dollars into California, at risk, and took a chance.  Itpaid off.  They succeeded as we all know this year, and probably willnext year, and so on.  But the 3,000 MW of new power plants underconstruction in California, and the 3,000 MW under construction inArizona, and the over 16,000 MW of combined power projects inCalifornia, Arizona, and Southern Nevada that are in line for permitswill change the financial landscape in a hurry once energized.  Theprices will soften, returns will be less cherry, and I really want toknow, where will today=0F s accusers be when there is a shake out?Consumers will reap that benefit, oh you best believe it. But thealliances to which your opening story alludes simply misses that point.You gotta make hay while the sun shines.Now to my proposal.   Michael, I would be willing to work with you todevelop some kind of loan program for residential and small commercialcustomers that would, in effect, reduce the economic hardship of higherelectricity prices.  I could imagine, although I haven=0F t tested the ideawith any parties,  that a significant program could be crafted, possiblysecured by the credit of participating generating companies, andexecuted by a commercial lending institution such as Bank of America.Borrowers would pay a fair interest rate and the administrative fees.It=0F s simply smart business, not charity.  It=0F s one way to amortize th=eearnings which came about due to a circumstance of short supply relativeto the sudden growth of demand for power.Maybe that is a step in the right direction, I don=0F t know. One couldargue that it is no different than SDG&E implementing a level paymentplan for it=0F s consumers.  True, it is no different, because in eithercase the customer is paying for the loan interest and administrativefees, and I consistently believe that a market for credit is moreefficient (am I getting impersonal?) than one instituted by amonopoly.   Second, the security for these loans is provided by partiesother than the utility=0F s customers.  Further, we wouldn=0F t have to wor=ryabout PUC oversight and prudence reviews.  We could make this workquickly.I will be very interested to hear your thoughts, and the comments of mymembers.

We should not rely on the PX to tell us what the level is. We should confirm it ourselves.  A skeptical regulator, looking at PX records should never be able to see that we ever did more than half our block forward business as financial.  One of the legal rules that we must comply with in this area is that there must be a bona fide commercial reason for going financial.  This dumbfoundingly simple sounding rule is important.  Somehow, when we communicate our decision to the PX to go from physical to financial, we should give our reason.  I m not sure whether our decision is expressed by phone, or electronically, but in either case,  the person making the change with the PX should get in an expression something like this:  \"we would like to change these trades to financial because we think the elimination of physical risk will benefit us commercially.\"  Please be patient with this self serving requirement and do it.

When I started this gig, I was theonly guy in town writing to folks like you about the power industry inCalifornia.  I wrote about what?s new, what?s happening, and all theimportant stuff.  This week, Governor Gray Davis decided to write hisown Burrito.  His epistle got more press than mine, but why is hemuscling in on my turf?  Not to be outdone, PUC President Loretta Lynchreleased a report which looks into every facet of California?s powerbusiness.  No stone left unturned. I?m telling you, there isn?t enoughroom in this business for all of us.  They need to clear out.With people like Herr (Hair?) Peace, Governor I?m-Not Mr.-Rogers Davisand Let?s Do Lynch, who needs a Friday Burrito?  They re-define ourreality each week with mind-numbing aplomb.  For example, starting inearly June, the PX was ordered to compete for business against otherQualified Trading Vehicles.  Then, two weeks later, the Energy F_hrerlegislated that idea to an early death which kept the status quo for atleast one year.  This week the PUC approved 5-year bilateral deals forPG&E and SCE, thereby opening the PX to competition, and emasculatingthe PX?s Block Forward Market. Zip, bam, boom.I can?t wait to see what next week will bring.  I hear Senator Bowen isholding Committee hearings on re regulating the industry, and theGovernor?s new Energy Security Council will meet to decide six things:What?s for lunch?Who will sit at the head of the table?Does anyone have good seats for next week?s Democratic convention?Is there anyone we haven?t indicted yet in the power industry?Who will crank up the air conditioning in this room?  It?s getting toowarm.Then, they will collect data from innocent businesses under subpoena,ignore the facts, and publish a report.  It makes one want to take adeep breath, and inhale the scented fumes of democracy.You know, I can?t think about where to begin, so let?s start somewhere.>>> Things on the Island of California @@@ Is there anyone left at SDG&E with a brain? @@@ The PUC issues its scathing report @@@ The ISO invokes $250 price caps.  Duh!>>> Things at the throne of FERC @@@ Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order>>> Odds and Ends (_!_)>>> Things on the Island of California @@@ Is there anyone left at SDG&E with a brain?Well, the answer very clearly is no.  I have been astounded by repeatedattempts of SDG&E?s most senior people to ape humans, but instead theymimic apes.Consider the following.  First, they waltz their default customers intothe summer with little of no protection from price spikes in thewholesale market.  Forgivable in that it is human to err.  The pricesskyrocket in June, and they start looking for who to blame.  _Must bethem damn independent generators,O say their managers.  Gary Cottoninforms the ISO Governing Board that hedging SDG&E?s position in theBlock Forward Market wouldn?t have made any difference.  There?s onenobel laureate who missed his prime.Next, under pressure, they ask for help from suppliers and anyone elsewho will assist the utility and their customers.  Nine offers show up attheir table, and they can?t choose any of them.  Again, Mr Cotton tellshis fellow ISO Governing Board members that these things take time, andwe don?t to rush since there are many legislative barriers, and, well,the surfing was good this week so why spoil it?Now they are in a panic because the Energy F_hrer is visiting old ladiesliving in trailer parks, advising them not to pay their SDG&Eelectricity bill, and to continue to operate their air conditioners.SDG&E puts a full page ad in the local newspaper telling everyone thatSDG&E is doing everything it can to lower their electric bills,including asking the ISO for a $250 price cap, but the public can helpby calling the ISO [address and phone number provided in the ad] andurging them to lower the cap.  I always thought the location of the ISOwas a State secret for security reasons.  No secrets in San Diego.But we are not done.  No sir, we are not.  Those buffalo heads who runthat company decide they will win a gold star on their collectiveforeheads, and implement one of the four resolutions passed by theElectric Oversight Board.  The one they pick is to petition FERC on anexpedited basis to cap at $250, the price at which sellers may bidenergy or ancillary services into the ISO and the PX.  The primaryreason is that Western power markets are not workably competitive.  Inother words, they want FERC to set a max price on what generators cansell in addition to the price limit at which the ISO can buy!What I find most astounding about this double talk is that SDG&Econtinues to collect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must runenergy into the PX.   These are sales from their stranded assets.  Theirgrief hasn?t abated their greed.So, to recap, SDG&E missed the boat on price hedging, failed to winconsumer confidence in public meetings, asked for help from suppliersand did nothing in response, then filed at FERC to cap the sale pricebecause the wholesale market into which they sell (over-priced?) energyis not workably competitive.  Too much time in the direct sun light.>>> Things on the Island of California @@@ The PUC issues its scathing reportThe PUC report released yesterday is a gem with which I have not spentenough time.  I only read the Executive Summary, and that only becauseour counsel, Dan Douglass forwarded me a copy. Let me pick out some ofthe gems in President Lets Do Lynch?s burrito.  I would recommendreading the whole text if you have time, and if you seek perverseentertainment._California is experiencing major problems with electricity supply andpricing caused by policies and procedures adopted over the past tenyears._ Since June, wholesale prices for electrical power in California haveincreased on average 270% over the same period in 1999, resulting inover $1 billion in excess   payments for electricity._Hot weather, aging power plant and transmission infrastructure, anddysfunctional bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets combinedto drive prices up ..._Because of serious market defects and tight supply of electricity,purchasers of California power will likely pay billions more inelectricity costs this year. Moreover, these price increases do notnecessarily fund new investments in electricity supply or deliveryreliability - they may flow solely to power producer profit margins._Despite the Electricity Oversight Board s legislative mandate tooversee those institutions, we have been unable to obtain [bid] data.Nevertheless, ... , we believe enough evidence of questionable behaviorexists that the Attorney General should conduct an investigation intothese statewide market practices, coordinating with other Stateagencies, including the PUC and the EOB. Such an investigation wouldprovide the factual foundation that California policy makers andregulators need to recover any illegally obtained profits._A momentous consequence of California s attempt to create a market inelectricity is that the federal government now regulates California selectric system. Washington D.C. now controls pricing decisions directlyat the wholesale level and indirectly at the retail level and, to theextent that supply incentives are correlated to prices, Washington, D.C.now affects California s ability to attract new investment in powerplants._Past administrations  willingness to cede the State s authority to thefederal government combined with the legislative creation of twonon-public supervisory organizations that have no duty to protect thepublic or consider the retail customer. The \"Independent SystemOperator\" (ISO) and the \"Power Exchange\" (PX), the nonprofit privatecorporations that operate the State s transmission system and controlwholesale pricing policies, are governed by boards whose members canhave serious conflicts of interest. Some of these board members or theircompanies financially benefit from higher prices in electricity markets.Neither of these private organizations is accountable to the State orits consumers ...._Despite the federalization and the fragmentation of the State selectric services, the State of California should protect its businessesand consumers from cartel pricing; collusive behavior; inadequate powerplant maintenance and lack of market planning for adequate electricitysupplies._California consumers and businesses deserve to know in advance - as SanDiegans did not this summer - how and when the price of an essentialservice like electricity will double. California is now largelyconstrained by federal mandates from providing comprehensive retailprice relief as long as wholesale prices remain so high. If Californiatried to re-impose a price freeze in San Diego now, federal regulatorswould likely prevent that action.  ... Short-term price relief, however,cannot resolve market gaming or fundamental wholesale pricing problemscontrolled by federal regulators. _We have been precluded from obtaining the data necessary to know ifthe ISO and PX failed to detect manipulation and gaming on severalfronts. We do not know how market players acted in price offering andbidding and scheduling. The FERC has just announced an inquiry intonational pricing and energy market issues. California should not waitfor national findings before it investigates California marketpractices. We recommend that the California Attorney General immediatelysubpoena relevant records and data to determine the pricing and offeringbehavior of market participants; the actions of the ISO and its boardmembers; and the actions of generators in supplying California s energyneeds._Ten Actions to Consider or Act Upon to Prevent Current ElectricityProblems From Spreading in 2001: ...     2. Create a California Energy Council, modeled on the National     Security Council, to unify State action to resolve energy     problems and to perform integrated energy planning;     3. Ask FERC for extended wholesale price cap authority to     moderate California wholesale market pricing;     4. Ask FERC to recognize the defects in the California and     western regional markets and find that no competitive market     exists in California power markets;...      8. Eliminate potential conflicts of interest in ISO/PX     stakeholder boards;     9. Improve California s ability to obtain ISO and generator     data and enhance the State s enforcement capability for power     plant maintenance; price manipulation and generation gaming,     consistent with protection of proprietary business     information;     10. Provide the EOB with effective enforcement ability and     additional oversight authority for the ISO and PX._Ten Issues to Consider or Act Upon Within the Next Six Months: ...     4. Streamline state power plant siting procedures; consistent     with environmental requirements, and prioritize applications     to advance clean, BACT+ power plant proposals.     5. Institute \"use-it -or- lose-it\" permitting power plant     licensing and emissions credits rules to ensure power plants     get built;     ...      8. Reform PX pricing protocols and structures to lower     wholesale and retail prices and reduce excess profitsOI told you I don?t need to write a Burrito anymore.  The Democrats inSacramento are doing that for me.  Welcome comrade.>>> Things on the Island of California @@@ The ISO invokes $250 price caps.  Duh!It is really hard to describe the drama of an ISO Governing Boardmeeting, especially when our favorite topic arises.  It seems the onlytime the Board becomes animated is when one of three issues are on theagenda: price caps, FTRs, and priorities for software enhancements.Otherwise, its pretty much hum-drum.%Round and %round we went, once again.  A few more forced votes tippedthe scale in favor of the cap.  There were 15 yes votes, which includeda forced yes vote from our friend Jerry Toenyes by order of Secretary ofEnergy Mr. Richardson. [Jerry, did you realize that the last letters ofyour name could be re-arranged to spell _NO ET YESO?  Kind of a frenchthing.] I?m sorry about that vote, Jerry.  You still go in my book asone of the brave and bold for standing up to that sort of intimidationfor so long.  Your picture in the SF Chron said it all.The brave souls who stood tall and voted NO included David Parquet(Enron), Jan Smutny-Jones (IEP), Barbara Barkovich (CLECA), CaolynKehrein (CMA), Dan Kirshner (EDF), and Stacy Roscoe (Procter & Gamble).Now, I must admit that Dynegy?s Greg Blue did help by voting a Texas No,spelled _A-B-S-T-A-I-NO.   I have instructed Dynegy trader Dave Francisin Houston to work with Greg to correct that problem.  We?re going towork things out.The Energy F_hrer addressed the Board, again.  I didn?t mind that I onlyhad a few brief, very brief moments to address the Board, and Herr(Hair?) Peace got over 20 minutes.  That didn?t bother me at all.  Hedid more damage to himself in 20 than I could do in 2.  He blasted awayat everyone who opposed him.  He pined about Camden quitting the Board.He said he knew how prices and markets work, that it isn?t the way thoseacademic egg-head, FERC-loving economists tell you who pray to the godsof competition.  He lambasted WAPA for withholding generation to protectfish and wildlife (what was that all about?).  He predicted that onThursday?s PUC meeting he and all the other powerful Democrats,Republicans and angry citizens of San Diego would demand that the PUCimpose a rate cap on retail electric rates in San Diego that are justand reasonable (it didn?t happen).  And on and on and on.  This man isvery delusional. He believes that Steve, and only Steve Peace can savethe world.  He believes that political will trumps judicial,quasi-judicial, or independent Board actions.  This man makes relevantall the abstract musings of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche(1844-1900) ... The will to power, the ?bermensch, the transvaluation ofvalues, etc.But we are getting under (uber?) his skin, with the help of the press.Wednesday afternoon I called Commissioner Dick Bilas to see if hethought whether the next day?s PUC meeting was going to be a roll over.Dick said he got a call from Peace, and that Peace said he would notcome to the meeting.  Apparently, Peace had received a lot of press, andall of it bad.That?s the thin line of freedom which keeps tyranny at least one stepaway from our front door. >>> Things at the throne of FERC @@@ Amen for the Morgan Stanley OrderAnd now, the good news.  You deserve this.  FERC gave the Californiamarket a little wiggle room last Friday.  FERC issued a last minutereply to the complaint by Morgan Stanley Capital Group relating to theISO?s intent to lower the price cap.  FERC denied the complaint, butthey didn?t waste time with an Order to simply deny a complaint.  FERCdanced on the head of the ISO and pulled the bite out of the price cap.Here are some excerpts:_We accepted this [Amendment 21], not because it was a cap on sellers?prices but because it would promote order and transparency in the marketby clearly telling sellers of the maximum price the ISO was willing topay and allowing sellers to make informed economic choices on whether tosell in the ISO market or to sell elsewhere..._ ... The ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energythan any other buyer of these services ... If the ISO is unable toelicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase priceceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose),it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meetits needs. ... Therefore, an increase in out-of-market (OOM) calls forgeneration may be necessary to maintain system reliability.  Because thecurrent payment for OOM is not subject to a maximum purchase price, theresulting overall payments may be higher._To the extent the ... ISO Board resolution contemplates implementing adirective that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO marketsunder any circumstances (e.g., when system load exceeds 38,000 MW), sucha requirement is not permitted by our ... Order and the ISO tariff. ...Future implementation of the ISO Board resolution with regard to arequirement to sell would require significant revisions to the ISOmarket rules.  Such market changes could not become effective absent acorresponding amendment to the ISO tariff which would have to be filedunder section 205 of the FPA.OWell. What do you think about that?Just wait.  Here is what the sleeping bear, Commissioner Hebert said inhis concurring remarks:_Getting to the bottom of the problem, in my view, requires us to begina proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as the operator of theCalifornia grid.  The record supports such a move. ... A memorandum tothe ISO from a stakeholder who resigned from the governing boardeloquently brings to our attention repeated attempts to undermine theindependence of the ISO. The memorandum also thoughtfully outlinesconsequences to the markets of a return to %command and control.?_Because these allegations come from a non-market participant,especially should we take heed.  We must also take notice of the publicpressure on the Board to compromise its independence.OAmen, brother, amen.>>> Odds and Ends (_!_)As you can imagine, this week, like an endless string of weeks beforethis has been interminable.  I get about three phone calls a day frompress reporters, very little of which ever sees print.  My shtick isjust too complex for casual readers.  But I do notice that the reportersare asking better questions.  The public is becoming more savvy.  Theinformation flow is moving in our favor, and will disarm the forces ofevil, in about 10 years.I have other problems on my mind.  I am working on a new computersystem.  Really, it?s just an upgrade of an older computer that is a bitfaster than the laptop I tried to upgrade, very unsuccessfully.  As aresult of the all the new hardware and software I purchased, my officelooks like a war zone with an odd mix of PUC service copies, computerdocumentation, and diskettes laying all around. Quite a mess.Prepare for the future.  Our next general meeting is scheduled forThursday and Friday, October 5 and 6 at Moro Bay.  Barb Ennis willprepare a blurb for us in next week?s Burrito about room reservations,timing, golf, etc.  Our guest speakers will include MSC ChairmanProfessor Frank Wolak who will talk on the subject of his choice, Ms.Irene Moosen of Grueneich Resource Advocates who will make apresentation on the distributed generation case before the PUC, andWilliam Freddo of PG&E National Energy Group who will give us someeducation on operating a power plant inside the New England ISO.Now for your daily bread, provided this week by Dan Douglass.  Last weekwe had a joke about Catholics.  This week it?s agnostics.=====================An atheist was taking a walk thru the woods, admiring all that theaccident  of evolution had created.  \"What majestic trees!  Whatpowerful rivers! What  beautiful animals!\"  he said to himself.As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushesbehind him.  As he turned to look, he saw a 7 foot grizzly bearcharging  towards him. He ran as fast as he could up the path.  Helooked over his  shoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on him.He tried to run even  faster, so scared that tears were coming to hiseyes. His heart was pumping  frantically as he tried to run even faster,but he tripped and fell on the  ground.  He rolled over to pick himselfup and saw the bear right on top of  him raising its paw to kill him.At that instant he cried out \"Oh my God!\" And time stopped. The bearfroze.  The forest was silent.  The river even stopped flowing.  Abright light shone  upon the man, and a voice out of the sky said, \"Youdeny my existence all  these years, teach others I don t exist and evencredit my creation to a  cosmic accident, and now do you expect me tohelp you out of this  predicament?  Am I to count you as a believer?\"The atheist, ever so proud, looked into the light and said, \"It would berather hypocritical to ask to be counted as a believer after all theseyears,  but could you make the bear a believer?\"\"Very well\" said the voice. And the light went out, the river flowed,the  sounds of the forest continued, and the bear brought both pawstogether,  bowed his head, and said, \"Lord, I thank you for this foodwhich I am about  to receive.\"==================Amen.  And have a great weekend.  Oh, and thanks to all of you who sentme happy birthday wishes.  It was very much appreciated.KSBgba - att1.htm","Robert_Badeer_Aug2000Notes FoldersNotes inbox"

The Commission also approved SCE and PG&E s motion to enter into bilateral agreements and schedule those transactions through the PX using the bilateral-option market.  These transactions will be confidential and will be disclosed only to the Commission s energy division, for purposes of reasonableness.  The Commission did not act upon San Diego s advice letter (#1242) to facilitate customer awareness of competitive alternatives.  That advice letter will not be acted upon until the next Commission meeting in September.The Commission has also opened an investigation into the role of the utility as a default provider and will explore how the utility should pass along its costs to the customers.  It will also address whether SDG&E should be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts in addition to PX purchases.  It also opens the door to consider alternative exchange.  This is a fast track investigation, so I will set up a call to discuss early next week.Sandi McCubbin and I were in Sacramento yesterday meeting with several of the key legislative offices.  There was also an interested party meeting (AB 1890 Implementation Group).  From those meetings, it was apparent that Steve Peace is interested in legislation to institute rate caps in San Diego, re-vamp the governance structure of the ISO and PX boards, having market participants (generators, marketers, utilities) share in some of the pain that San Diego s consumers feel, extend the rate freeze, etc.  Although, most of the other legislative offices saw this proposal as a total morass.The legislative offices that we met with, while interested in providing some political cover to DeDe Alpert (Senator from San Diego in a close political race), were not interested in pursuing sweeping changes to the current structure, although this could change.  However, it should be noted that DeDe Alpert said herself that she would introduce rate cap legislation in San Diego when the legislature reconvenes on August 7.  Most of the discussion with the other offices was on what can be done by next summer and focused on bringing on peaking plants and expanding demand responsive programs.Sandi and Dave Parquet also met with John Stevens, of the Governor s Office.  He stated that the Governor did not want any major changes to the current structure to come across his desk, but that the Governor needed our help in preventing such changes from getting there, otherwise he may be politically compelled to sign the legislation.  Sandi will send out more information later, she s having computer problems.There will be a hearing next week of the Senate and Assembly Energy Committees on San Diego issues on August 10.We, in GA, will keep you updated on developments.","Robert_Badeer_Aug2000Notes FoldersNotes inbox"

The resultant rolling \"brown outs\" and the potential for blackouts in thefuture could have a noticeable empirical and real impact on industrial production inCalifornia and even in the national statistics. Indeed, the impact is likely to be greatest in thehighest value-added sectors: computers and computer components, two industries thathave been a key engine of U.S. growth. Not only that, electricity generation is an important proxy in the FederalReserve s estimation of industrial production. So, the measurement of statisticscould be directly affected. About half of the industrial output contained in the industrial productionindex is compiled on the basis of actual output volumes - tons of steel, boardfeetof lumber, or millions of autos assembled, etc. For other forms of output, accounting forabout a quarter of the index, contributions to total production are estimated basedon hours worked data, with the implicit assumption that productivity - or the rateof real output per labor hour - doesn t change much over short periods of time in theseindustries. But the remainder of the index, about 26% according to a Fed economist, isestimated using electricity generation measures. For this purpose, electricity generation is itself estimated from measuresof electric power usage by industry. Here, as with productivity, the technicalcoefficient, or the amount of electricity input per unit of output, is assumed to be constantover relatively long periods.         As Usual, Things Are Different In California California power companies, as part of the deregulation of the electricpower industry, offer their business customers \"interruptible rate plans\". That means thatfor a discounted rate, customers \"voluntarily\" allow the power company tointerrupt their power supply in times of peak demand. Too bad. The heat of summer combined with continuing strong economic activity has,in fact, resulted in widespread interruptions throughout California. And there is a precedent for how such interruptions can have both astatistical and real impact on production: the San Francisco earthquake of October 1989. That quake disrupted electricity generation, particularly south of the cityin Silicon Valley. Largely as a result of that disruption, national industrialproduction declined by 0.5% (0.6% in manufacturing) in October 1989. The computer and semiconductor chip producers in Silicon Valley andelsewhere in the state are very heavy users of electricity. It is reasonable to expect thattheir total consumption of electricity, and their output, have skyrocketed since 1989. This industry has a twofold importance to the rest of the national economy. First, chips are essential inputs to the production of other industriesfrom \"smart chips\" in cars to central processing units for computers. Thus, a bottleneck inchip supplies because of electricity interruptions could have ripple effects beyondCalifornia. Second, chip production is among the highest value-added activities in theU.S. economy - each stage of production adds significantly to the value of totaloutput. This means that the specific shock impact on this industry could have a greatlymagnified effect on overall economic activity. The usage is not confined to chip production, however. An extensive rangeof other California-based industries - from chemicals to textiles - have intensiveelectricity usage in their production. Their production will be estimated lower because of the reduction inelectricity. And in fact, real production will be lowered by a reduced electricity input. Ironically, these interruptions could complement the Fed s efforts to sloweconomic activity and take some of the pressure off for further rate increases. Whatinfuriates Californians might actually be a welcome development for the rest of us.    -By John McAuley, Dow Jones Newswires, 201-938-4425    john.mcauley@dowjones.com Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

Clinton also ordered the release of $2.6 million from the Low Income HomeEnergy Assistance Program to help low-income families in Southern California. TheSmall Business Administration will urge its lending partners to use SBA creditprograms to help small businesses with their energy costs. Clinton is taking the action because of a steep rise in the wholesale priceof electricity, the statement said.

This change in turn, preventedthe meter data that was directly collected by the ISO at the intra-tie/loadpoint to be used in the Settlement calculations.The effect of this change was that from Trade date April 27, 2000 untilcorrected for Trade date June 28, 2000 the UFE calculation was performedwithout the proper data representing the intra-tie point between the SCE andPasadena UDC territories. This caused UFE to be more positive in the SCE UDCterritory and more negative in the Pasadena UDC territory.

The bill was sent to the assembly s appropriations committee because some representatives are concerned about who - if not SDG&E customers - will payfor electricity in the city this summer and past spring. The difference betweenwhat SDG&E customers would pay under the legislation and what SDG&E is paying forsupplies in the skyrocketing electricity markets has been estimated at $1.5 billion. Assembly Passage Of Measure Uncertain The legislation would roll back electricity rates to June 1, 1999, levelsfor customers of SDG&E, a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE). This spring and summer, the utility s customers have received electricity bills that are nearly triple what theywere last year. Electricity rates for the state s other utilities haven t been deregulatedyet, so their customers are receiving fixed prices per kilowatt-hour of power used. Prospects for passage of the bill, AB 2290, are unclear in the Assembly.The California State Senate passed the bill unanimously last week. But it would need 54votes to pass through the 80-member Assembly before Gov. Gray Davis could considersigning it into law. If all 47 Democrats approve the measure, it would need at least sevenRepublican votes to pass. But, as reported Tuesday, only three Republican lawmakers saidthey would support the bill. The rollback would provide some economic relief to SDG&E s 1.1 millioncustomers, who have been paying market-based rates for electricity since June. If therollback is approved, utility bills for residential customers would be about $55 to $60a month, according to SDG&E. Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said the governor hasn t decidedwhether he would sign the bill into law if approved. Monday, the state s Public Utilities Commission rejected a proposal to rollback rates, instead approving a stabilization rate plan that would reduce the cost ofelectricity to about $68 a month for residential customers who conserve usage. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604;mark.golden@dowjones.com Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

FPL will file with the Commission in September for permission torecover the expense in customer bills beginning Jan. 1, 2001.Part of this increase will be offset by a refund to customers that iscurrently estimated to be $75 million to $100 million. The refund ispursuant to an agreement reached in April 1999 with the Office of the PublicCounsel and the FPSC that provides for revenue sharing between FPL and itscustomers, as well as a 6% annual rate reduction for three years. As aresult of the forecasted fuel costs and the expected rebate, residentialelectric rates could increase by approximately 13% per kilowatt-hour.The cost of oil used to generate electricity has more than doubled since thefirst quarter of 1999 and has not been this high since the Gulf War in 1990.Since January 2000, oil prices have increased 44% per barrel. Natural gasprices also have risen unabated, climbing 77% since January 2000. With theonset of winter, natural gas prices may increase further as demand forheating fuel increases./////////////////////Market Brief    Thursday August 24Stocks  Close   Change  % ChangeDJIA    11,182.74       38.1    0.3DJ 15 Util.     358.51  (5.7)   (1.6)NASDAQ  4,053.28        42.3    1.1S&P 500 1,508.31        2.3     0.2Market Vols     Close   Change  % ChangeAMEX (000)      50,373  (7,710.0)       (15.3)NASDAQ (000)    1,548,008       85,370.0        5.5NYSE (000)      825,146 (41,307.0)      (5.0)Commodities     Close   Change  % ChangeCrude Oil (Oct) 31.63   (0.39)  (1.23)Heating Oil (Sep)       0.9533  (0.00)  (0.29)Nat.

The meeting is a broadstakeholder meeting to help refine our load participation programs for 2001.Much of the day will be committed to presentations and discussions onlessons learned from 2000 and proposals for 2001, including technicalstandards, contractual issues, and load management.  Some vendors have approached the ISO with systems that wouldaggregate loads, give them an opportunity to curtail based on day aheadenergy prices, and provide the curtailment instructions and verifications.This type of program may be ultimately sold to ESPs or IOUs. In order toaccelerate the testing of such systems the ISO may sponsor a pilot programto test the system/approach with selected vendors.  The pilot program willtest the concepts, the interfaces, and assist in bringing together vendors,ESPs, SCs, and the IOUs as we move forward toward improving demandresponsiveness in our markets.  We have reserved about 1 -2 hours in theafternoon, to allow 3-4 vendors to present their approaches to thestakeholder group.  In addition, we welcome you to visit a vendor fair that theISO is hosting on September 21, 2000.  The ISO has  experiencedconsiderable interest from the market place in such a vendor fair that wouldinclude entities providing Data Processing Gateway technology for bothGenerators and Loads in the Participating Ancillary Services Load Program.This effort is being encouraged to develop multiple solutions pertaining toinstallations of direct telemetry for Generators and Load providingAncillary Services to the ISO markets.

The ISO Governing Board earlierthe same day turned down the ISO management s request to force SCs toplace 95% of their scheduled load in the DA market.  That leaves the ISOlittle choice but to venture into the energy markets to procure power tocover their peak hours on hot days.Terry gave Ziad the OK to proceed with placing both the APX andCalifornia PX screens for this new product/matching-service.  I amworking with the two vendors and the ISO to make this happen quickly.We anticipate that the market will open on Tuesday, September 5, orearlier.Key people who you may need to contact:ISO - Ziad Alaywan  916-351-2140 (Nancy Traweek and Jim McIntosh arealso in the loop)PX - Ken Czarnecki 626-537-3123PX - John Yurkanin 626-537-3124APX - Denice Cazalet 408-517-2123APX - Michael Heinrich 408-517-2159Please feel free to contact me with your questions.  Several of you havenot had the opportunity to attend the pre-design meetings we had at theCalifornia PX and APX a few weeks ago, nor were you aware of the jointWPTF/ISO meeting held last week.  But in essence, what thisproduct/matching-service will allow you to do is post bids to sell, orbuy a 6-hour block of capacity at a firm energy price across the hoursof HE13 to HE18.  You can bid at COB, Mead, PV, SP15 or NP15.  You canutilize either the CalPX or APX to post your bids, because the ISO willbe watching both screens.  The block sizes are (supposed to be) 25MW.The seller is responsible for arranging transmission to the deliverypoint, and the buyer (e.g., ISO) is responsible for arrangingtransmission service from the delivery point.  The ISO will make itspurchase decisions for the day-of at or before 8:00 a.m.  The ISO willsend out a general notice when it needs offers to sell on the super-peakmarket.  I expect that bids for either buy or sell will be able to beposted at any time, 24 hours.  The screens should allow parties to postbuy or sell bids at least 60 days forward of the trade day.You are not limited to a price cap in these markets, but the ISO as abuyer has the right to not purchase at prices above it s price cap.I think WPTF members should be very proud that we were able to quicklywork together, and with the ISO to create this market. I have no doubtthe ISO will be offering bids to purchase starting Sept 5, and goingforward 60 days.  However, who among you will be willing and able topost bids to sell?gba","Robert_Badeer_Aug2000Notes FoldersNotes inbox"

The utility confirmed today that is in\"preliminary talks\" with a number of third parties, but stressed it was\"very early days\". The move follows \"a number of unsolicited expressions ofinterests\" in the business, including its operatorship. TXU said it isreviewing this part of its business and will only decide whether to sell atits conclusion. It has not set a deadline for the review.A source inside the company was not surprised at the review: \"The businesshas changed a lot in the last year.\" TXU has already put up its UKgeneration assets for sale, and this latest move to divest gas assets couldmark a shift in strategy to focus on trading and retailing. Some analystsbelieve that assets no longer give \"competitive advantage\" to energycompanies, as the focus shifts towards the end-user and convergence of gasand electricity.TXU s principal production assets comprise the operating licence and 64.2%of the 83bn ft? Johnston gas field, plus 14.75% of the 33bn ft? RavenspurnNorth field, 11.24% of the 5bn ft? Welland field and 4.83% of the 17bn ft?Schooner field.

The ISO Governing Board earlierthe same day turned down the ISO management s request to force SCs toplace 95% of their scheduled load in the DA market.  That leaves the ISOlittle choice but to venture into the energy markets to procure power tocover their peak hours on hot days.Terry gave Ziad the OK to proceed with placing both the APX andCalifornia PX screens for this new product/matching-service.  I amworking with the two vendors and the ISO to make this happen quickly.We anticipate that the market will open on Tuesday, September 5, orearlier.Key people who you may need to contact:ISO - Ziad Alaywan  916-351-2140 (Nancy Traweek and Jim McIntosh arealso in the loop)PX - Ken Czarnecki 626-537-3123PX - John Yurkanin 626-537-3124APX - Denice Cazalet 408-517-2123APX - Michael Heinrich 408-517-2159Please feel free to contact me with your questions.  Several of you havenot had the opportunity to attend the pre-design meetings we had at theCalifornia PX and APX a few weeks ago, nor were you aware of the jointWPTF/ISO meeting held last week.  But in essence, what thisproduct/matching-service will allow you to do is post bids to sell, orbuy a 6-hour block of capacity at a firm energy price across the hoursof HE13 to HE18.  You can bid at COB, Mead, PV, SP15 or NP15.  You canutilize either the CalPX or APX to post your bids, because the ISO willbe watching both screens.  The block sizes are (supposed to be) 25MW.The seller is responsible for arranging transmission to the deliverypoint, and the buyer (e.g., ISO) is responsible for arrangingtransmission service from the delivery point.  The ISO will make itspurchase decisions for the day-of at or before 8:00 a.m.  The ISO willsend out a general notice when it needs offers to sell on the super-peakmarket.  I expect that bids for either buy or sell will be able to beposted at any time, 24 hours.  The screens should allow parties to postbuy or sell bids at least 60 days forward of the trade day.You are not limited to a price cap in these markets, but the ISO as abuyer has the right to not purchase at prices above it s price cap.I think WPTF members should be very proud that we were able to quicklywork together, and with the ISO to create this market.

We re going to be in trouble.\"Thanks to a break in this summer s high temperatures in California, the ISOmanaged to find the power it needed Monday and bought it under the new pricecap of $250 a megawatt-hour. It also looks to be able to make it throughTuesday.But the real test could come with higher temperatures forecast for Wednesdayand Thursday - or whenever the next heat wave comes.The state s power grid is run by the ISO, established by the state slegislature to ensure that California s utilities were getting enough powerto meet their customer needs.Utilities typically buy most of the power they need a day in advance basedon weather forecasts and system capacity. A different state-charteredorganization, the California Power Exchange buys most of the power theutilities need one day ahead of time.The ISO is supposed plug unexpected gaps by purchasing marginal amounts ofpower on a last-minute basis as necessary.But the price cap is changing the way the game is played.Prices in the ISO s real-time market are capped at $250 a megawatt-hour. Butprices in the CalPX s day-ahead market are uncapped and free to skyrocket.As a result, California s main utilities - PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas& Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison andSempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric - will buy only thosesupplies available on the day-ahead market that are bid at the ISO cap orless.That policy makes sense - electricity is widely regarded as the mostvolatile commodity in existence, prices can rise 100-fold in a matter ofdays and California s prices are about four times their level last summer.But it isn t the most sustainable.Grid Operator Left To Cover Large ShortfallOn Monday, for example, the California PX reported that the utilities boughtall the power suppliers bid in below the price cap, a total of 27,500megawatts of supply for peak afternoon hours.But as the sun rose over the California sky and air conditioners ramped up,the three utilities needed 40,000 megawatts of power to meet demand -leaving the ISO not just to tweak the system, but to buy almost a third ofwhat was required.\"It makes it a lot harder for our people to operate the system,\" ISOspokesman Patrick Dorinson said.On Monday, the ISO had to leave its official, computer-based market andscramble to secure needed power supplies from neighboring utilities bytelephone, as it has done numerous times this summer.The question for California is whether independent generating companies andutilities outside the state will sell their power to the state at or belowthe $250 price cap, or whether they ll be able to sell their output for ahigher price elsewhere.Like much of the rest of the country, the western U.S. now needs moreelectricity during summer afternoons than it can generate. The boomingelectricity-driven new economy has been met with almost no additions togenerating capacity. Companies that have generating capacity are looking fortop dollar.\"Our real-time folks  job is to optimize revenue and get the highest pricefor that energy that they can,\" said Larry Bryant, spokesman for the PublicService Co. of New Mexico (PNM), which regularly sells power to California.\"There is no preference of customer. There s preference for maximizing therevenue that hour of that day.\"The $250 cap, half what it was until Monday and a third of what it was untilJuly 1, is well under prices the western wholesale power market has seenfrequently this summer.The ISO has the authority to break its own cap if necessary to keep thelights on, but doing so could make a shambles of the state s official powermarket.Traders at utilities with excess power to sell say they will have noincentive to bid in supply on the ISO s computer system at prices under thecap if they know the ISO will be picking up the phone later with sweeterdeals.\"At 10 a.m. the ISO operators have to run around and find a sufficientamount of capacity in the West to serve our needs, and on some days therereally is only a limited amount of capacity to go around,\" Smutny-Jonessaid.\"We re going to have figure out a better way of managing this,\" he added.-Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.comCopyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

Pulizzi   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRESWASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Now that gasoline prices are finally settling down,economists say another energy component could prove to be a spoiler on thegovernment s main consumer inflation gauge.Amid a shifting regulatory landscape and typical summertime price increases,the nation s utilities appear to be boosting consumers  electricity billsenough to skew the Labor Department s July consumer price index. Those gainswould partly offset the anticipated favorable influence of recentlydeclining gas prices.\"There is a real chance of starling increases in electricity prices over thenext month or two, thanks mostly to the bungled deregulation of theindustry,\" Ian Sheperdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economicsin Valhalla, N.Y., wrote in a recent report. \"All the anecdotal evidencefrom the West and East Costs suggests consumers are reeling from suddendouble - and in some cases triple - digit percentage increases in theirbills.\"First Union economist Mark Vitner agreed: \"It is a potential trouble spot,it is a particular problem in the West.\" In California, where no new powerplants have been built in a decade, the private companies that purchasedplants from the state s utilities have been raising prices in response tostrong demand and dwindling supply.The impact of the cost increases will be revealed Wednesday, when the LaborDepartment releases the July CPI next Wednesday.Economists generally expect the figures to point to a continued tameinflation scenario - a 0.1% overall monthly increase, featuring decliningclothing, computer and gas prices is forecast. Labor Department economistPatrick Jackman said recent statistics suggest gas prices fell 3% to 3.5%last month. That would mark a departure from June, when soaring prices atthe nation s gas stations contributed to a big 0.6% spike in the CPI.Rising Demand, Surging PricesBut electricity, which represents 2.5% of the entire index, will be a wildcard in the coming report.Electricity costs usually rise in the summer as consumers pay more for thejuice that powers their air conditioners. This summer is no different,Vitner said, adding that utilities have even more pricing power than normal.\"Overall demand for electricity has been rising. All this high-techequipment uses a lot of electricity,\" Vitner said.Indeed, prices rose 0.8% in June after seasonal adjustments. Before thoseadjustments, prices surged a whopping 6.6% during the month.As for a July increase, Jackman said \"it certainly is a possibility. Thequestion is how are the seasonal factors are going to handle it.\"Sheperdson, however, believes it s clear that electricity costs are on therise. \"Three factors are driving prices higher,\" he said. \"First, flaws inthe auction system set up after deregulation effectively allow thegenerating companies to manipulate prices at times of high demand. Second,the economic boom means that periods of high demand are much more commonthan was anticipated at the time of deregulation, so generators have moreopportunity to extract premium prices from distributors and, hence,consumers. Third, little new electricity-generating capacity has been addedin recent years.\"Producer prices, which Sheperdson says provide a good guide to movements inthe CPI, may offer ominous insight into the potential consumer electricityprice gains. Residential electric power prices on the producer level rosefaster in July than at any point since January 1991.And they aren t expected to slow down anytime soon. August could beespecially problematic because higher electricity costs will coincide withanother pickup in gas prices and continued gains in natural gas prices,Vitner said.\"We have no idea how far the CPI measure of residential electricity pricescould rise, but there must be a good chance that substantial increases willbe recorded,\" Sheperdson said. \"With natural gas prices also climbing again,following a dip in July, it may take a while before energy ceases to pushinflation higher.\"-Henry J.

Apple Computer Inc.(AAPL) was one of the businesses left in the dark, along with other firmsand consumers in a five-county area, as the utility, a unit of PG&E Corp.(PCG), rotated off blocks of 35,000 customers for 60 to 90 minutes at a timeafter other attempts to reduce demand failed.  Apple considers itselfrelatively lucky because it was able to keep doing business that day thanksto a contingency plan, according to spokeswoman Lynn Fox. Whether thatback-up plan includes buying in alternative electricity or some other meansApple wouldn t say.  What is sure is that as Silicon Valley expands throughthe nation s most populous state - and California shows no sign of quicklyresolving its power problem - technology firms large and small are amongthose businesses that stand to suffer financially from lost production time.These big power consumers are spending a lot of money to back up theirregular electricity sources, industry observers said, and in some cases thatspending may be as much of a bottom-line factor as the power outagesthemselves.  Unreliable power costs the U.S. economy about $50 billion ayear, said Bernie Ziemianek, of EPRI, a Palo Alto, Calif., think-tankfocused on power issues and technology. Ziemianek thinks that figure - whichconsiders lost productivity and the cost of equipment and products damagedduring a power interruption - could double in the next three to five yearsbecause of the growth of Internet-related activity and electronic commerce.Mark Mills, co-author of the Digital Power Report, a trade newsletter,believes that cost is already higher because the economy is increasinglydependent on reliable power. It is no longer just hospitals and militarybases that can t do without uninterruptible power; semiconductor makers,telecommunications providers and a host of other industries cannot dowithout full-time electricity.  By the end of the decade, Internet-relatedactivity and e-commerce could account for about 25% to 35% of the total U.S.electric demand, said Raymond James analyst Frederick Schultz, compared withabout 8% in 1998.  \"The new U.S. economy can scarcely survive the annualpower outages and interrupted service problems that have plagued the powergrid over the past few years,\" Schultz said.       Hot Days, Hot Economy -And Hot Debate    Although the California power outage made headlines acrossthe country, rolling blackouts in the state are about as rare as atraffic-free Los Angeles freeway. Indeed, the state has never declared aso-called Stage 3 emergency, which occurs when the statewide power reservefalls below 1.5% and involuntary power interruptions may begin on a widescale. Rolling blackouts have been more common in the East Coast and theMidwest, which are two areas that also are susceptible to storm-relatedoutages.  While some industry watchers have faulted deregulation for thestruggle to meet power demand in California, others argue that hot weatherand robust economic growth are to blame. The truth probably lies somewherein the middle.  A year ago, California s weather was cooler than usual, butthis year the state has had a hot summer. On June 14, the day of the BayArea blackout, the temperature in San Francisco reached 103 degrees, a levelnot seen for 135 years. That spike, coupled with overall growth inelectricity usage, pushed the power grid to its limits.  \"Over a 10-yearperiod, this state will need 10,000 megawatts of additional energy to keepup with the growth we are seeing now,\" said PG&E spokesman Greg Pruett.Indeed, with hot summer weather, and new capacity still a long way off, thenumber of Stage 2 emergencies California has declared is on the rise. In aStage 2 emergency, power reserves are below 5%, and many utilities begin tocontact accounts that have identified themselves as \"interruptiblecustomers\" and ask them to reduce their usage by set amounts. Thoseso-called interruptible customers are typically commercial and industrialaccounts.  By early August, the California Independent System Operator haddeclared nine Stage 2 alerts, said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for thenonprofit agency that manages most of the electricity flow around the state,compared with one in 1999 and four in 1998.  During a Stage 2 alert,interruptible customers agree to cut their consumption, when asked, inreturn for lower electricity rates, and often help to stave off the need toresort to more serious measures such as rolling blackouts. However, it canbe a double-edged sword for the commercial customer, which can face steepfines if it fails to comply with the order. Penalties can offset the savingsthe company stands to gain from the program, and that s even beforeaccounting for the cost of lost productivity.  Aerospace and defense giantBoeing Co. (BA) and technology distributor Ingram Micro Inc. (IM) are twocompanies operating facilities in California under the interruptiblecustomer program. During the first week of August, each was called upon toreduce its power consumption. Both companies see the program as a way to actas good members of the community while saving money.  \"The manufacturing ofa rocket takes two to three years,\" said Walt Rice, a spokesman at Boeing sHuntington Beach, Calif., facility. \"The impact (of a Stage 2 powerreduction) is fairly outweighed by the cost savings,\" he said.  \"We live ina state where there is a high demand for electricity, we are doing things toshed even a small amount of that demand,\" said Paul La Plante, senior vicepresident of worldwide facilities for Ingram Micro.  Still, companyofficials admitted compliance isn t without inconvenience. Companies need towork closely with utilities to determine the number of power interruptionsthey can tolerate, Ziemianek said, but that determination can be difficultto make.  For example, while a semiconductor plant operator knows a merebrownout can destroy a day s production and prepares for this event, theoperator of a commercial bakery may be unprepared for the disruption abrownout can have on the microchips embedded in its machinery, Digital PowerReport s Mills said.  Companies such as Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) andQwest Communications International Inc. (QWST) are spending more money onsystems either to back up, replace or supplement the electricity suppliedfrom the power grid than the entire electric industry is spending by afactor of at least five, possibly 10, said Mills. \"The stakes are too high,if you are Nasdaq, a dotcom or a fab maker,\" he said.       Other PowerOptions    For that reason, companies are trying to be savvier about theirpower usage. Earlier this year, Oracle Corp. (ORCL) considered going off thepower grid entirely by building its own power generation facility. Aspokeswoman for the Redwood Shores, Calif., software company wouldn tprovide further details of the plan s progress.  This option may seemsevere, but it s one reason why the makers of power turbines are faced withextensive order backlogs, and it s also driving demand for uninterruptiblepower supplies, such as those manufactured by companies like EmersonElectric Co. (EMR), and for new power technologies such as fuel cells,flywheels and microturbines - some of which are still years away fromcommercial viability.  Others, like Silicon Energy Co., are developingproducts to allow utilities and their customers to better manage theirelectric consumption. Silicon s software allow its users to track theirreal-time electricity consumption.  With this in mind, Mills suggests thatthe real financial impact of power interruptions isn t the money companieslose on these events, but the value of what companies are willing to spendto cushion the blow of blackouts when they occur.  -By Christina Cheddar,Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.com  Copyright(c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

Surging power prices plaguingthe state this summer \"do not reflect legitimate forces of supply anddemand,\" SDG&E said, calling on FERC to impose across-the-board electricityprice caps in California of $250 per megawatt-hour indefinitely until themarket flaws are corrected.  But the power producers rejected SDG&E sanalysis of the market problems as \"simplistic,\" and called the impositionof price caps on all California power sales an unwarranted response to thepower supply shortage.  \"SDG&E asks the commission to take unreasonable andunprecedented action that would effectively rescind every Californiasupplier s authority to sell energy and ancillary services at market-basedrates,\" complained Southern Energy California, a subsidiary of Southern Co.(SO).  \"A strict cap will only exacerbate the current supply shortages inCalifornia,\" Southern Energy and the other power suppliers argued.  \"Theimposition of this cap by FERC may discourage power developers from choosingto serve California markets,\" said Dynegy Power Marketing Inc. (DYN).  \"Thecap may also convince (electricity users they) need not participate inload-reduction programs, since paying the $250 price cap is cheaper thanshedding load,\" Dynegy told the commission.  \"The imposition of caps onevery California market, and the increased uncertainty as to when - if ever- they might be removed, sends precisely the wrong message to potentialsuppliers of energy in California,\" Southern Energy said.  The arguments ofthe individual power producers in the state were echoed by the ElectricPower Supply Association, the national trade group representing competitivepower producers and marketers.  Imposing price caps in California s volatileelectricity prices would \"suffocate markets\" and do nothing to address thechronic power-supply shortages causing prices to spike, EPSA told FERC.\"The relief SDG&E seeks would actually prolong and intensify California sdifficulties,\" EPSA said.  Price caps would discourage electricity importsand investment in new power plants to supply the state, while discouragingprice risk management, liquidity and accurate price signals, EPSA said.FERC has already allowed the California Independent System Operator to capthe price it is willing to pay for power, which it uses to assure the gridoperates properly and to make up \"energy imbalances\" on the system.  The ISOrecently lowered its purchase price cap to $250 per megawatt-hour. The SDG&Epetition asks FERC to extend that cap to the state s power exchange, or PX,which operates as a clearinghouse for wholesale power sales in California.\"A PX bid cap is unnecessary because the ISO purchase price cap hashistorically acted as a de facto cap on the PX markets,\" Dynegy told FERC.-By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647; bryan.lee@dowjones.comCopyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

Allegations Said Unsubstantiated  Thereisn t a shred of evidence to support allegations, said Severing Borenstein,director of the University of California, Berkley s, Energy Institute.\"There are no antitrust laws that state you can t charge a premium price forpower,\" Borenstein said. \"Manipulation is a bad word. That s used in thecommodities market to find a loophole and take advantage of the rules.  \"Iwould say this is exercising market power. ... If you want to charge highprices you can. These are guys who play against each other every day. Thereis no sort of collusion that would interest the justice department ... .\"The reason for the inquiry ordered By Gov. Gray Davis, he said, is as aconsequence of San Diego consumers being the first in the nation to paymarket-based rates for electricity.  The high wholesale costs paid byutility San Diego Gas & Electric, a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE), were passedon to ratepayers and resulted in utility bills more than doubling.  Gov.Davis ordered the inquiry and asked federal regulators to conduct their owninvestigation as well.  Dynegy (DYN) President Steve Bergstrom also saysthat an investigation \"will turn up nothing.\"  So why conduct one?  \"This isa very politically charged issue,\" Bergstrom said. \"When something goeswrong you have to find someone to point the finger at.\"  A source in thegovernor s office said Davis is aware that Attorney General Lockyer sinvestigation may turn up nothing, but Gov. Davis \"has a responsibility tohis constituents.\"  Supply vs. Demand  What the investigation will turn upis evidence that there is a shortage of power in the state and not enoughpower plants being built to meet increasing demand, said Terry Winter,chairman and chief executive officer of the California Independent SystemOperator.  Winter said he doesn t believe that there is anything wrong withthe way generators sell their power and 98% of the time the market workswell.  \"Is it market abuse to bid at the price cap ($250 per megawatt-hour)knowing that you re 1,000 MW short? I have trouble identifying that asmarket power abuse,\" Winter said.  Despite some proposed regulatory changes,such as bid caps on wholesale energy prices and a rate freeze for SDG&Ecustomers, Duke Energy, Dynegy, Southern Co. (SO) and Reliant (RLI) allstill plan to invest in generation in the state.  That s a different stancethan the companies took a month ago when the ISO reduced the wholesale pricecap in the real-time market to $250/MWh.  \"At the end of the day the marketis short power and you got to get people to build new generation,\" saidDynegy s Bergstrom. \"We got a big investment in California. We re notwalking away from that.\"  -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires;323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones &Company Inc12:15 GMT 16 August 2000 DJ Calif ISO Urges FERC To Reject Pwr Producers Complaint(This article was originally published Tuesday)WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--California s power grid administrator Monday urgedfederal regulators to reject a complaint from power producers seekingcompensation in the event out-of-state power transactions are curtailedduring an extreme power grid emergency.The independent system operator told the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission that the power producers seek compensation in the event of a\"situation that never has occurred any time since the ISO began operations,and if it were to occur in the future, would do so rarely.\"The ISO noted that its tariff governing access to the state s grid alreadyallows for compensation in the event of curtailed exports, and decried thepower producers  complaint as \"a collateral attack\" on a previous FERC orderrejecting claims that the tariff failed to provide adequate compensation.Curtailing scheduled power transactions and exports would be a last resortmeasure taken only after other options have been exhausted, the ISO said.The power producers should adjust their contracts to factor in the risk ofinterruption in the event of a state-wide grid emergency, the ISO said.The ISO s objections were echoed by the state s electricity distributionutilities and California regulators.They complained that the power producers are merely trying to get out fromunder the price controls the ISO has imposed in an effort to rein inskyrocketing power prices this summer.The generators \"knew when they purchased California power plants and whenthey entered into their export contracts that the ISO could alter theirschedules in an emergency. For them to ask the commission to make it evenmore expensive, and hence, more difficult, for the ISO to maintain gridreliability in California is irresponsible,\" said Southern CaliforniaEdison, a unit of Edison International (EIX).\"The complaint is a sham,\" declared the California Public UtilitiesCommission.\"The true intent of the complaint ... is to avoid the ISO price caps bymaking sales to affiliates or cooperating entities located out of state, andsell the power back to the ISO at uncapped prices reflecting the generators market power,\" the PUC said, calling for FERC to summarily reject thecomplaint.\"The complaint is factually unsupported, legally unfounded, complains ofconduct consistent with the ISO s authority under pertinent FERC decisions,and seeks to avoid the price cap,\" the PUC said.But power marketers and other power producers voiced support for thecomplaint, filed Aug. 3 by Reliant Power Generation Inc. (REI), Dynegy PowerMarketing Inc. (DYN) and Southern Energy California (SO).\"By subjecting curtailed energy transactions to its maximum purchase priceof $250, and simply ignoring the financial impact on sellers, the Cal ISOwould be overtly discriminating against export transactions and marketparticipants who schedule energy for export,\" said the Electric Power SupplyAssociation, the national trade group representing competitive powerproducers.\"It is critical that power producers ... know with certainty that thecurtailment of scheduled energy exports by Cal ISO will be compensated,\"said Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.\"Now that the ISO Governing Board has lowered purchase price caps to $250,it is significantly more likely that the curtailment of exports will occurmore frequently. Less energy will be imported into California and moreenergy will leave California in search of higher prices,\" said WilliamsEnergy Marketing & Trading Co. in support of the complaint s call for actualdamages and lost opportunity costs.At least one power purchaser voiced support for the producers  position aswell.\"It seems a very basic point that if the Cal ISO must divert thetransactions of others to meet its own loads, that is should pay the fullcosts of doing so,\" said the Northern California Power Agency.-By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647; bryan.lee@dowjones.comCopyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company IncG_nther A.

He said that the daily block forwards transaction fee has been waived for July and Aug. (.02 transaction charge).  However, the tariff was changed on May 2nd that increased the settlement (aka clearing) charges to .03 per mwh per day.I asked him why the daily block forwards are so expensive when we get the .01 charge as a preferred customer on the term block forwards.  He said it s because of the costly bookout process.  I told him we do financial onlys, but not bookouts, and restated that .03 is more expensive than brokers.  He said that because the tariff filing of .03 was the maximum, these fees can be negotiated away from the .03 max., especially since we don t add to the costs of bookouts.   So, whoever among us is the queen or king of daily block forwards, or our block forward accounts in general, I suggest we do negotiate a lower rate on the daily schedules.Both Brett and I tried to access the tariff on the PX website, but we couldn t read it.  So, if someone has better clearance or web tools than us, please let us know so we can update ours.","Robert_Badeer_Aug2000Notes FoldersCapx"

The ISO Settlements andMetering Department staffs are in the process of recalculating the specificmarket charges impacted, for this period.Actual retro-active UFE adjustments will commence on July 3, 2000, and beapplied initially to the May 9th Preliminary Settlement Statement (PSS). TheISO s intention is to correct 15 settlement days per week over the next 10weeks until the entire 1999 August 21-December 31 period settlements arecorrected.  The ISO Settlements system time required to rerun settlementsconstrains our ability to proceed more expeditiously.  However, we do plancompletion by the end of Summer.The ISO will apply retroactive adjustments to ALL UFE related Marketcharges. The erroneous UFE identified by the ISO UFE Project will be chargedto the responsible Scheduling Coordinators (SCs), to help assure that noadverse market impact occurs from cost shifting.  Other SCs will receive theassociated charge type credits.FINAL REPORT TO MARKET PARTICIPANTS - Fall 1999 ISO UFE PROJECTOn August 21, 1999, UFE in the PG&E Service Area increased substantially,ranging from 4-15 %.   This inordinately high UFE continued in excess oftypical amounts of UFE for this UDC Service Area (-1 to +1%), for fourmonths.The ISO actively investigated potential systemic causes for this order ofmagnitude increase in UFE.ISO efforts consisted of a concerted review of SQMD submitted by SC s duringthis period, a review of the ISO MDAS polled meter data for ISO meteredentities, a review of interchange data (exports), a review of theTransmission Loss calculations used by ISO Settlements to calculate UFE byUDC, an investigation of the Market Redesign Settlements software changesassociated with the drop of new Settlements software in mid- August and theretention of a data consultant to help identify and isolate any causalfactor, attributable for the high UFE .The effort to identify UFE related settlement issues for the period ofAugust 21, 1999 through December 31, 1999 is complete.  The ISO UFE Projectteam, working in conjunction with Market Participants, identified over 1.1million MWH of erroneous UFE. This UFE is now accounted for, and will bereassigned to the responsible SCs. The ISO Project identified over 14 casualsources of UFE during this period.  Many of the issues identified wereinterrelated.The last major source of UFE for the period was identified in April. ThisUFE resulted from an erroneous Validation, Editing and Estimating (VEE)factor, applied to firm load within the PG&E Service Area.  This error,associated with late or missed meter data adjustment, commenced October 1,1999 and resulted in understated SC load of approximately 100 - 267 MW/hour,through December.The balance of the SC meter data management errors previously identifiedwere attributable to the complexity of using Pseudo Resources and LogicalMetering to model, schedule and settle Municipal UDC existing contracts(ETCs).The four primary SCs which experienced meter data problems, within the PG&EUDC Service Area, have resubmitted corrected Settlement Quality Meter Data(SQMD).The ISO will initiate retroactive UFE Market adjustments for the Settlementperiod of August 21,1999 through December 31, 1999.  The magnitude of theMarket UFE adjustment is approximately $70 million. These retro-activeMarket adjustments will complete the Project Team s work on the Fall 1999UFE issue.Present UFE Status:March 2000 UFE, based upon Final Settlement Statements (FSS), is as follows:System UFE         +0.22 %PG&E UDC Service Area UFE   + 0.17 %SCE UDC Service Area UFE    + 0.44 %SDG&E UDC Service Area UFE   -  0.45%ISO UFE Project TeamSarah Ten BroeckKevin GravesBill HayesKyle HoffmanTri HuynhGlen PerezJeanette PlumleyChris SibleyJune 15, 2000CRCommunicationsClient Relations Communications","Robert_Badeer_Aug2000Notes FoldersCalifornia"

Comments are due on June 27.  Unless you tell us otherwise, we plan to file and seek expedited treatment. (The CPUC has no required timetable in which to respond.)  We expect the CPUC to approve them -- there is pressure from many fronts to DO something about load participation in the market.  Both have asked for a July 17 effective date.DETAILS:SCE s is a much better document and makes a good case for CPUC approval, even though the the customers are already benefitting from providing the utilities with the option to curtail during system emergencies. SCE proposes the following approach to prevent \"double-dipping\" by the customers:  If the ISO directs SCE to activate its load curtailment program during the time period that the customer has an accepted bid from the ISO in the A/S market, SCE -- working with the ISO -- will adjust the customer s bill to avoid double payments.  SCE provides no more information, but, on principal, this seems fair to me.  We ll have to watch to see what the proposed procedure would be.PG&E doesn t say much except that it is \"unable\" to offer this to bundled customers (oh, gee -- must be more of those \"system constraints\") until \"later\" (unspecified).  I would expect large customer groups to argue about that -- but it gives us the opportunity to push direct access.  PG&E didn t have much to offer on the \"double-billing\" issue -- it said either PG&E could change the customers bill or the ISO could adjust its payment.FERC threw out all the protests by various parties (e.g., MWD, M-S-R, other munis) and approved the ISO s proposal.  The big issues were:  supposed improper allocation of demand relief program costs (ISO allocates it to all SCs based on metered demand during all hours of the program);q request to charge those who are out of balance for most of the costs; the need to file pro forma agreement in advance (FERC said ISO doesn t have to); and the supposed overly restrictive program participation. If you want to know more about the order, give me a call.Have fun!Sue Mara","Robert_Badeer_Aug2000Notes FoldersCalifornia"

Therefore, in the near term, the Cal PX is the only trading vehicle for the utilities.Our lobbyists found NO support in the legislature to buck the language.  Principally because the president of the Commission, Loretta Lynch, was the one seeking a legislative fix to unwind a decision that her agency issued.  She had greased the skids with both the Republicans and the Democrats to support the language.  So, as a result, the only thing that the Commission can do at this point is study the affects of introducing competition with the Cal PX and issue a report to the legislature by June 1, 2001.  Prior to that date, the Commission cannot implement any decision on this issue.  Effectively, by the time any change would occur, we could be at/or near the end of the transition period, when the mandatory buy/sell requirement would terminate.We can encourage the Commission to study this issue and use the time as an opportunity to educate the Commission(ers) about Enron OnLine.

This was the second meeting that was held to discuss thisidea.  Represented were the CAISO, APS, PNM, TEP, EPE, TNP, APSES,NewEnergy, Enron, Calpine, PG&E Gen, Southern, Duke, Cal PX, and DOE.The issues that were discussed included the CAISO s ability to implementthe major components of the DSTAR commercial model, the changes thatwould need to be made in the CAISO s governance and internal structure,and costs.The parties at the meeting were generally in favor of:  (i)consolidating the existing control areas into a single control area assoon as possible, (ii) migrating to a common set of market protocols ona fairly rapid basis, (iii) creating a single, independent, RTOgoverning board with no bias in favor of either California or the DesertSouthwest region, and (iv) migrating from a regional advisory committeestructure to a single advisory committee structure as soon as possible,to avoid balkanization and accelerate convergence.  Most parties feltthat there were, at this time, no \"show-stoppers\" on most of the issues.For many of the participants, the most significant outstanding questionswere: (i) the costs (both $/MWh and cost shifts) that Desert Southwestparties would incur under the consolidation scenario, and (ii) timing -i.e., whether the necessary implementation, governance andorganizational changes could be put into place by a target date of June2001.It was agreed that the next step was for the CAISO, working withinterested parties, to provide a tentative implementation cost (bothwith and without consolidation of DSW control areas, but in both caseswith independent procurement and operation of ancillary services).The agreed-upon Action Plan was as follows:June 9: CAISO to develop list of questions which need to be answered toenable it to develop a cost estimateJune 16: CAISO to respond to the list of questions generated at the June5 meetingJune 16:  CAISO to be provided with responses to the CAISO s list ofquestionsJune 16: Transmission owners to provide to the CAISO their definition ofthe scenario(s) that they desire the CAISO to consider in developing itscost estimateJuly 10: CAISO to provide cost estimateJuly 20: Meeting in Phoenix to discuss the cost estimate, address anyadditional questions, and discuss the viability and possible contents ofa Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)July 31:  Decision from all interested parties regarding their desire tomove forwardAugust 15: Assuming a positive outcome on July 31, meeting to discussfinalization of an MOU which would address the commitments of theparties, market structure, changes in governance, organizational goals,priorities and structures, etc.Status:  The first four items above are close to completion.   The CAISOhas sent a list of technical questions to Carl Imparato and he iscompleting a response.  The CAISO is completing its response to the listof questions it received on June 5.  The interested transmission ownershave defined the scenarios that they wish to see considered by theCAISO.When all of these documents are finalized, which I expect to occur inthe next 2-3 days, I will forward them to all of the addresses.If you have any questions, please give call me at 510-558-1456.Carl Imparato","Robert_Badeer_Aug2000Notes FoldersCalifornia"

This CMR recommendation represents an essential milestone inthe broader Congestion Management Reform Project.  The first stage involvedsoliciting stakeholder input regarding the problems to be solved,alternative solutions to address these problems, and criteria for evaluatingreform proposals. The second stage involved the CAISO s crafting anintegrated, internally consistent reform package utilizing the ideasdeveloped with and/or by Stakeholders in stage one. This document containsthe CAISO s draft recommendation. We emphasize that, although we believethis recommendation package to be a necessary milestone in the CongestionManagement Reform Project, it is not intended to predispose the finaldesign. We are actively soliciting Stakeholders  comments and critiquesconcerning this recommendation over the coming weeks (stage three of the CMRproject).  Once the next round of stakeholder input has been assessed,the CAISO will revise this CMR recommendation. The revised recommendationwill be presented to the CAISO Governing Board for discussion and reviewonly on August 1 (no Board action requested). The CMR recommendation willcontinue to be developed through August and the final recommendation will besubmitted to the CAISO Governing Board for approval at the September 6th and7th meeting.  The approved CMR recommendation will be prepared (inconjunction with Stakeholders) for the final Tariff filing to FERC inNovember (stage four). A revised, detailed calendar will be presented at theCMR Stakeholder meetings on July 13 and 14.  At the July 13 and 14 Stakeholder meetings, the CAISO willpresent the entire recommendation, section-by-section and provide theopportunity for Stakeholders to clarify their understanding of what is beingproposed. Shortly thereafter, we will hold additional Stakeholder meetingsto facilitate detailed discussion of individual elements of therecommendation.

The FERC has made itclear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to lift the price caps.On Friday, the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July 10 complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (\"MS\").  As you may recall, MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISO s maximum purchase price authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions.  MS sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule 206(h), which was granted by FERC on the grounds that the complaint \"warrants expeditious action.\"As a quick background summary for you, last November, FERC issued an order approving Tariff Amendment 21 which extended ISO s price cap authority through 11/15/00.  That order stated that the ISO \"maximum purchase price was not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO, but a cap on what the ISO was willing to pay.\"  The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the price cap could \"choose to sell those services into the California Power Exchange or bilateral markets.\"FERC notes in Friday s Order that the 6/28 the ISO s Board resolution lowered the caps to $500 and ISO further directed that, \"To the extent permitted by law, regulation and pre-existing contract, Management shall direct generators to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds 38,000 MW.\"The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would, \"threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace.\"  MS also requested an emergency technical conference to examine ISO s justification for the price cap reduction.FERC denied the MS stay request, as well as its request that the $750 maximum purchase price be reinstated.  The Commission reiterates that it is not approving a cap on sellers  prices, because they can sell at whatever price they want.  Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to pay.  \"Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO, the ISO cannot dictate their price.\"Importantly, however, FERC also states that, \"ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services....if the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs.\"  [Emphasis added]  FERC then notes that this may lead to an increase in Out of Market (\"OOM\") calls and that OOM calls are not subject to a maximum purchase price.Also, with regard to the ISO s resolution stating that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds 38,000 MW, FERC states clearly that, \"such a requirement is not permitted by our November  12 Order and the ISO tariff.\"  [Emphasis added]FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISO s market rules, which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to ISO s tariff.  This would require 60 days  advance notice, \"and could not be implemented prior to Commission approval.  As stated above, our November 12 Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate supply (due to a low maximum purchase price) is to raise the maximum purchase price.\"ISO is then \"put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper response to low supplies in the ISO markets.\"Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert.  Massey suggests that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues, such as risk management tools, removing constraints on hedging opportunities, introducing real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new generation and transmission projects in California.  Hebert says that the previous November Order tried to \"straddle the fence\" and that, \"Today, the Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of recognizing that we have a role.\"  He then reiterates his preference for removing all price caps.  He also suggests that, \"Getting to the bottom of the problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid.  The record supports such a move.\"  He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter, stating that it, \"thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a return to  command and control.  \"  Hebert states that, \"The independence of the ISO s governing structure stands threatened.  We should  stand up,  to quote the resignation letter.\"  Hebert advocates opening a section 206 proceeding now, as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power markets, \"including the California markets.\"This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrow s meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that price.  This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO.Please call if you have any questions.Dan","Robert_Badeer_Aug2000Notes FoldersCalifornia"

The document does not fully address all of the issues discussed at last Thursday s congestion reform meeting in Sacramento, but I believe that (other than for some details) it is consistent with what both the ISO and many of the market participants are proposing.This summary does not necessarily reflect the views of my clients, who haven t yet had the time to review it... but I don t believe that it would be too far off.  I am sending this summary to you to put into context the many comments that I offered at last Thursday s meeting and also to support my view that, if the ISO were to implement the CONG/ASM integration by DECENTRALIZING the process rather than CENTRALIZING the process, there would not be much difference between what I ve been advocating in the Southwest and the CAISO s model.  (The primary remaining differences would be: (i) the way the \"hour-ahead\" process works - i.e., continuously vs. one discrete time; and (ii) the way scheduling is done - i.e., the ISO would not act as the SC s representative in acquiring rights that could be made available through inter-zonal counterflows since the SCs would do this themselves.)  So there is a real possibility that, with some agreement on the ISO s longer-term plans (whether integration of transmission rights and ancillary services procurement will rely on decentralization vs. centralization), we could bring together the models for the region.

My friend, =Ol=0F Dave in Houston, has trouble understanding the workings of our powerbusiness here in California.  In fact, so do I.  Yesterday=0F s JointSenate/Assembly Committee on Energy and Natural Resources did nothing toimprove either Dave=0F s or my understanding of the national embarrassmentCalifornia is perpetrating with electricity deregulation.=0F\"The next thing you know, they will be taking property, and forcingutilities to build power plants and transmission,=0F\" he mused between sipsof Dixie longneck beer and chomps of jalapeno peppers.  =0F\"Come to thinkof it, Dave, they did say something about that. Yeah,=0F\" I recalled,=0F\"Senator Peace was expounding on his favorite idea which is forcing theISO or the utilities to build peakers, and not let the market buildthem.  I can=0F t remember if that was before or after he suggested to EOBChairman Kahn that the ISO and the PX should be folded into Stateagencies under the direction of the Electric Oversight Board.=0F\"I know what you are thinking right now.  The next thing you knowCalifornia will have regulated retail rates.  That recipe should be outof the PUC=0F s oven sometime next week.=0F\"Well, the power marketers are jigging the system, bidding up to theISO=0F s bid cap.   There is no way you can tell me that a generatorplanned to make $750/MWH in its pro forma,=0F\" Dave added. =0F\"So you agreewith Herr (Hair) Peace!  You don=0F t believe in markets,=0F\" I retorted. ==0F\"Oh,I believe in them, but I remember when I was short on a 300 MW trade,and without any notice or advanced warning, the price in the Midwestmarket went against me,=0F\" Dave recalled.  =0F\"I called everyone who I tra=dedwith, and they had nothing.  I finally called XXXXX, and I asked whatwill it cost for 50 MW?=0F\"=0F\"Why didn=0F t you ask for 300?=0F\" I wondered.  =0F\"I didn=0F t want to= show him myposition.  You get hosed when you show the buyer your position.  Ask for50, first,=0F\" Dave chided.=0F\"What happened?=0F\" =0F\"Oh, they offered to sell for $150/MWH.  I said I==0F dtake it, and then said I needed another fifty.  He asked $300.  I tookthat, and he priced the next 50 MW at $600,=0F\" lamented Dave.  =0F\"He justwanted to see how far he could push me. That=0F s what I mean when I saythe traders are jigging it.=0F\"=0F\"But Dave, you old communist, your forgetting the trading function iswhat mitigates the risk. The traders are the in between people who guessat the price.  Sometimes they guess right, and sometimes they guesswrong.  But the damage, or the reward, is on their book, not passed onto the ultimate consumer. It has nothing to do with the marginal cost ofa generating plant.=0F\"And there you have it.  Put in a price cap, and the traders have atarget for which to shoot.  I can=0F t prove the following, yet, but I=0F l=lwager with any of you that as the price cap level dips down, the averagetrading price climbs even as the so-called =0F\"dysfunctional=0F\" price spik=esare eliminated.  Consumers get hosed, and the fundamental economicprinciple is upheld, which is, one can never be made better off with theimposition of an additional constraint.I feel better already.  Here is what is on our short agenda this week.>>> Things in the Mailbag>>> Things in the People=0F s Republic of California @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB Report @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate Hearings @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale Market>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)>>> Things in the MailbagIt has been awhile since we put the mail feedbag on and had a munch.Here is what my friends have been writing me.FPL Energy=0F s Steve Ponder was only too quick to tell me, =0F\"Please Gary=,no more whining about your computer.

They make the pain of separationso much easier. And Steve, when you FPL guys get that Entergy mergersorted out, in a dozen years or so, you let us know. I want toparticipate in the name selection for the new entity.  How aboutFentergy PLus?Next, from the PX=0F s Mark Hoppe, who writes, =0F\"As you ve heard fromothers, I don t know quite how you manage to knock out all this materialeach week. The burrito is informative, humorous and usually contains asprinkle of irony, tragedy (ISO Drama).  Though you are usually neutralregarding the PX, you are not unduly negative which I appreciate.  Ithink we do a pretty good job over here and so often people in theindustry forget the amount effort and challenge it took the PX tosuccessfully open this market.=0F\"Thanks, Mark.  I just want you to know that my ability to write thisstuff every week is not constrained by the facts or evidence.  I havelearned from watching Herr (Hair?) Peace, that as long as you can talk(write, too) fast, and have conviction in your statements, regardless ofhow groundless they may be, you will have a willing and eager audience.A few weeks ago, I received from the PX=0F s Jennifer Sherwood a note,which she wants you to know are her opinions, not necessarily the PX=0F s.It=0F s okay, Jennifer.  I paid George,yesterday, the $20 I owed him forthat sham Rose Bowl bet, (remember?, Stanford lost) and your opinionsare cool with us.  =0F\"Just curious - has anyone been comparing highunleaded prices to high CA electricity prices?  What I mean is, we areup in arms about how we should protect the unfortunate San Diegoconsumer who can t afford to keep the AC on. But what about the inflatedunleaded gas prices the whole country has seen over the last fewmonths?  No effort is made by the government to shield the consumer fromhow much it costs to fill their gas tank.  No mention is made of thosewho can t afford to drive to the grocery store because they can t affordthe extra 15 or 20 cents a gallon.  The costs are passed along to theconsumer without pause.  Granted there are differences between theunleaded market and the electricity market in terms of demand-sideresponsiveness, but then again is it that much different to say, =0F`Ican t drive today because gas is too expensive=0F vs. =0F`I can t turn up the AC today because it s too expensive.=0F =0F\"Finally, from one of our [secret] Washington readers, and I am nottelling who, I received the following: =0F\"I ... broke down and listened tothe [ISO Governing Board] discussion and vote.  Ugh!  I too noted thatthe \"speak fast\" was applied to everyone but Herr Peace.  My goodness,what a mess we have.  I loved Jerry s picture in USA Today -- it spokevolumes.  My sources at FERC tell me, though, that we should keep an eyeout for {FERC Chairman] Hoecker to do something really ... [Censored]... for political reasons.  Given no Commission meetings til September,the only way to act is by unanimous consent, so I would hope he can t doall that much.=0F\">>> Things in the People=0F s Republic of California @@@ The ISO Replies to the EOB ReportSeveral of you people commented to me that the ISO=0F s reply to thePUC/EOB report was very good.  I decided to excerpt the best sections ofit for the Burrito.  The full document can be found on the ISO=0F swebsite.=0F\"... the [PUC/EOB] Report asserts that the suspected activities ofcertain generators on June 13 created frequency instability leading tothe Bay Area blackouts the following day. In fact, the events of June 13and June 14 were completely independent of one another. The voltageinstability on June 14 was caused by system conditions on that day alone-- exceptionally high loads, insufficient generation in the specificlocal area, and transmission constraints that prevented the import ofgeneration from outside the area.=0F\"The Report states that the ISO =0F\"never tried=0F\" to call upon consume=rs toreduce demand in order to avoid the Bay Area blackouts. In fact, the ISOhad in place on June 14 a number of demand response programs designed toreduce load including the Summer 2000 Demand Response Program, underwhich customers have agreed, through a prior solicitation, to curtailenergy use in exchange for a fee=0F\"The Report makes a number of assertions concerning the prices paid by=0F`purchasers=0F  of energy as a result of the recent price spikes (e.g. $=1.2billion in the month of June alone). These assertions leave one with themistaken impression that these prices reflect amounts actually paid bythe UDCs and/or passed through to customers. However, in determining thetotal cost of energy, one must determine the impact of any forwardcontracts entered into by the UDCs in advance of the wholesale energymarkets. These contracts, which are designed to =0F\"lock-in=0F\" a specificprice in advance of real-time or near real-time market activities, arespecifically designed to mitigate the impact of price volatility, andare standard in all commodities markets. We have reason to believe thatsome of the UDCs were substantially hedged during the period of therecent price spikes.=0F\"In a similar vein, the reports asserts that California =0F\"might well==0F\"have saved $110 million dollars had a $250 price cap been in place inMay and June. This assertion assumes that all energy purchases wouldhave been made at or below the $250 bid cap. In fact, during times ofpeak demand, when all of the state=0F s generation has been exhausted, theISO competes with neighboring regions for available generation. In orderto secure the necessary power, the ISO must purchase, on a bilateralbasis, this energy from resources located outside of the ISO=0F s controlarea.=0F\"The Report asserts that California power markets =0F\"are not nowcompetitive=0F\" and implies, erroneously in our view, that this is thenormal state of affairs. It is not. The Market Surveillance Committeehas noted that =0F\"market power in the California energy market appears toariseprimarily during periods of peak demand,=0F\" and warned that demand growthwould increase the incidence of market power during the summer of 2000.=0F\"The Report asserts that the ISO is answerable only to a self-interestedboard and not to the citizens of California. This simply is not thecase. The ISO is subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act andto the rules and regulations of FERC, which dictate, in part, thatwholesale energy rates must be just and reasonable and in the publicinterest. The ISO further operates under a detailed tariff reviewed andapproved by FERC. Every change to our market design and virtually everyaspect of the ISO=0F s business is subject to review and scrutiny by FERC.The FERC process provides substantial opportunities for input by thestate agencies and such agencies have, in fact, been active participantsin the FERC proceedings.=0F\"The Report asserts that California supply conditions have been affectedby restructuring and that somehow the restructuring choices have madeCalifornia more vulnerable to supply shortages. This assertion isunfounded. Significant load growth in California and neighboring statescoupled with a lack of significant infrastructure investment in bothgeneration and transmission have caused this vulnerability.Restructuring has increased proposed power plant applications many fold.Only by immediate and sustained attention to streamlining approval andsiting processes for both of these critical infrastructure elements willthis significant shortage be addressed.=0F\">>> Things in the People=0F s Republic of California @@@ Reflections on a Day of Senate HearingsIf you want to imagine a scary sight, imagine, then, twelve Californialegislators gathering together in one hearing room to rectify the wrongsof electric restructuring.  Also imagine, as if you are in the TwilightZone, witnesses that are slow on their feet, and reckless in theirfacts.  Then you get a glimpse of what yesterday=0F s Joint Senate/Assemblyhearing was like.It started over two hours late.  The Senate was busy congratulating oneof their own who is term-limited out next session, and they wanted toheap on the glory.  That said, the show began with CEC Commissioner BillKeese.  Mr. Keese has one story, and regardless how well he tells it,and he does, it is always the same story.  It is the heat storm story.One can imagine in the heat storm story a lead character who is asingle-mom, call her Lady-Bird Bowen, who travels across an angry landwith her precocious pre-teen child, Stevie Wonderboy.  They aresearching for electric power plants in the dessert, which, by the graceof God have been shipped to other countries which have more liberalreturns on investment.Being the first speaker, Mr. Keese took at least half the heat (storm)of the day.  The rage of the Energy Fuhrer was palpable.  Last week, SanDiegans shed 350 MW of load last week to save the entire system, and didnot receive one penny of compensation (I=0F m not making that up ... Hesaid it).  He is sick of hearing about demand management as being asolution for the problem over the last five years, and he is about donelistening.  People in San Diego are depressed by the sudden pricehikes.  Yikes!Keese did mention that the California reserve margin has sunk to 7%, butin neighboring Arizona, the reserve margin is -1% or -2%!!  Mr. Keesecorrectly pointed out that electric power is not solely a Californiaproblem, it is a regional problem.  One member of the Committee askedwhat the legislature could do to speed up the power plant siting andconstruction process?Keese referred to Governor Gray Davis=0F  Executive Order issued last weekto which the CEC plans to respond soon, date uncertain, that lays out a6 month permitting time line.  The six months are enough if theapplicant has the land secured, zoning okayed, transmission access, andair offsets.  Hmmmmmm.  That alone might take six months before you getto the CEC.The next panel included Mr. Kahn of the EOB, and Ms. Lynch.  I went toohard on her last week, calling her Let=0F s Do Lynch.  That was a 0.8 TPC.Sorry.  I promise to be nicer starting now.  The Energy Fuhrerinstructed Ms. Lynch to use her authority to order SDG&E to divert thepass through of funds from the customers to the PX until the dysfunctionof the market is cured.  Put it in an escrow account.  Ms Lynch promisedto review this option at her August 21 PUC Meeting where she will enactSDG&E rate caps (told you).The star of the day, I thought, was FERC General Counsel Doug Smith.Mr. Smith comes to Sacramento.  Isn=0F t that a switch?  Mr. Smith came inplace of Mr. Hoecker, thank the Lord.  Mr. Smith put into FERC-eese whatthese 12 legislators could not get through their heads any other way.The 12 angry legislators were looking for a way for FERC to declare thewholesale market as non-competitive, and then ask the generators to giveback the money they over collected.  When can we do that?  Mr. Smithanswered as only a FERC attorney can answer.  There is a process.  Ittakes time.  You must have evidence.  FERC uses a three-part criteriafor assessing whether or not market based rates are allowable.  It=0F sbased on market concentration and dominance, not the existence of highprices.  You would have to sue FERC in federal court, and the best youcould hope for is for FERC to reconsider its decision upon remand fromthe US Court of Appeals.Slowly, the wind came out of the sails of the gang of 12.  They werestumped.  Herr (Hair?) Peace screamed, couldn=0F t you, Mr. Smith of FERC,today use your authority to declare the markets non-competitive, thatgenerators who had market based rates have exercised market power, andretro-actively implement a $250 rate cap across the Western region?Like a wheezing accordion, Mr. Smith played back and forth the familiarstrains of music, like a solo street musician on the corner.  Back andforth: the process, the process, the process.  There have been times inthe past I hated the process at FERC.  Today, I have a renewed respectfor what process affords me and you ... Freedom from the tyranny of amob.For the remainder of the hearing, they focused on remedies that could beundertaken by the PUC.>>> Things in the People=0F s Republic of California @@@ PUC Issues OII on Functioning of Wholesale MarketWell, the official title is, =0F\"Order Instituting Investigation into theFunctioning of the Wholesale Electric Market and Associated Impact onRetail Electric Rates in the Services Territory of San Diego Gas &Electric Company=0F\".  I like my title better.This Order, or OII was issued at the last business meeting of theCommission, on August 3.  It calls for an investigation of the wholesalemarkets, responses from the three UDCs, and a pre-hearing conference inSan Diego on August 29 at the San Diego Convention Center.Here are the questions the PUC wishes us to address:=0F=07 What bill payment options should be provided to assist residential a=ndsmall commercial customers? (What does this have to do with thefunctioning of the wholesale market?)=0F=07 Should SDG&E be authorized to participate in bilateral contracts orother supply procurement activities? How should the Commission assessreasonableness?

How should state/federal concerns be addressed?=0F=07 What are the causes of the price increases?  Are anticompeititvepractices causing some of the price increases?  Are there mechanisms theCommission can employ to make ratepayers whole?>>> Odds & Ends (_!_)As promised last week, I have a message from our event coordinator, BarbEnnis, regarding the upcoming WPTF General Meeting on October 5 and 6.Listen up!She writes:Hi Folks......Well it is almost that time again....WPTF s October General Meeting willbe held at the Inn at Morro Bay, Sixty State Park Road, Morro Bay,California 93442.

Some people want the California Independent System Operator to be a lot less independent. The Folsom-based nonprofit corporation, which acts as the traffic cop for the state s electricity grid, has been a lightning rod for criticism during this summer s power crisis. Though generally praised for keeping lights on in the face of severe shortages of electricity, the ISO has come under fire for failing to move more quickly to lower the maximum price it will pay generators for emergency power to meet demand and prevent blackouts. Pressure on the ISO has eased considerably since last week, when its governing board voted to lower the cap on such same-day, emergency purchases -- the only type of pricing it has the power to affect directly -- to $250 a megawatt hour from $500. But the heat hasn t been turned off completely. Some lawmakers still are calling for changes in the 26-member ISO board, which includes people nominated by power generators, utilities, middlemen, and commercial and residential customers, among others. The critics want to streamline the board and make it more accountable to the state s elected officials. The ISO was created by the state s 1996 utility-deregulation act to transmit electricity smoothly between generators and utilities. Lawmakers devised the independent board as a way to give the various \"stakeholders\" -- generators, utilities, middlemen, customers and environmentalists -- a say in how energy is supplied. Members serve for up to three years. \"It s inappropriate for the ISO governing board to vote on issues that benefit them financially,\" says Sen. Dede Alpert, a Coronado Democrat. She questions the wisdom of allowing out-of-state energy sellers and marketers to sit on the ISO board and vote on emergency prices, especially when they have an interest in keeping those prices high. Sen. Alpert spent much of the Legislature s recent summer recess fielding complaints about high electricity costs from her constituents, customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., a unit of San Diego-based Sempra Energy. Last summer, SDG&E became the first investor-owned utility in the state to have price regulations fully lifted. This summer, its rates have doubled, as high temperatures and power shortages have swept the West. In response to a series of price spikes in Southern California and the wider contention that skyrocketing prices indicate the failure of deregulation, state lawmakers have scheduled a joint hearing tomorrow in Sacramento. High on the agenda: possible changes in the ISO s governing structure and scrutiny of the way it handles power statewide on hot days. Critics say emergency purchases should be no more than 5% of electric-power sales, but were as high as 33% of the market on hot days earlier this summer. Key legislative leaders -- including Sen. Steve Peace, an El Cajon Democrat who was the architect of the 1996 deregulation law -- would like to make the ISO more accountable to state elected officials. Possible changes include preventing industry representatives with conflicts from sitting on the ISO board, as well as abolishing the ISO entirely and shifting its responsibilities back to state utilities, under the supervision of the state Public Utilities Commission. Until 1996, the PUC regulated all electric utility rates and services. ISO board members say legislative critics are unfairly focusing anger over the price spikes on the ISO, which has only a limited ability to set prices. Most electricity isn t sold through the same-day, emergency market -- but through long-term contracts between sellers and utilities, or at least a day in advance through the California Power Exchange, which is a nonprofit corporation established by the 1996 law to serve as a trading floor. \"We need to create a government structure that is not susceptible to pressure from one state senator or anyone else,\" to keep prices artificially low, says ISO Chairman Jan Smutney-Jones, who represents the Independent Energy Producers Association, the trade group for non-utility power generators. He dismisses criticism of the board s out-of-state members. There needs to be \"an independent, interstate board\" because energy is transmitted across state lines, he says. Two Houston-based power sellers on the board, Dynegy Corp. and Enron Corp., deny any conflict. Chuck Watson, Dynegy s chairman and chief executive, blames state officials for expanding the ISO s role to include monitoring prices. \"If there s any finger-pointing,\" Mr. Watson says, \"they probably should start with the big finger pointed right at them.\" Substantial restructuring of ISO governance could prove difficult. The state, through the governor-appointed Electricity Oversight Board, has limited power to make changes. Past efforts by the Oversight Board to exert control didn t go far. Last year, state lawmakers tried to give the Oversight Board the power to confirm or reject ISO board members to make them accountable to state officials. (Nominees had previously gone on automatically.) The effort was opposed by officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington, D.C., which argued that the state couldn t have veto power over the nominees of out-of-state power producers. In a compromise, California officials were given authority to veto half the board -- those nominated by residential, industrial, commercial and agricultural power-users. The federal energy commission has final regulatory authority over the ISO and has viewed state attempts to meddle with the agency as an unconstitutional attempt to hinder interstate commerce. Any proposed changes in ISO s governing structure \"would be looked at very closely by FERC,\" says ISO attorney Richard Jacobs. This summer, the ISO board displayed an independence that was annoying to state lawmakers. In June, Sen. Peace called on the board to lower its price cap for emergency purchases, from $750 a megawatt hour (roughly the amount of electricity needed to power 1,000 homes) to $250. The board responded by lowering the cap to $500 a megawatt hour. A second attempt to lower the cap to $250 failed to get a majority vote. The reason? The three private power-seller representatives, including the Independent Energy Producers Association, were joined by those representing agricultural, industrial and commercial users in opposing a lowering of the cap. Then, the pressure on the ISO board really intensified. Gov. Gray Davis weighed in, by sending the ISO board a letter asking it to lower the cap \"to the lowest possible level.\" Energy Secretary Bill Richardson ordered the representative of federal-public-power sellers to change his vote from no to yes. A consumer representative from the League of Women Voters also moved to the \"aye\" column, allowing the cap to be lowered to $250. Lowering the cap removes some of the rate pressure on residential and commercial consumers in San Diego -- and takes some of the heat off the ISO board. But not entirely: A Public Utilities Commission report on the state s electricity market that was sent to the governor after the vote said that the members of the ISO and the Power Exchange boards \"can have serious conflicts of interest\" and that both organization aren t \"accountable to the state or its consumers.\" An ISO spokesman said the board is in the process of producing a formal response to the report and it declined to comment. A spokesman for the Power Exchange said that it has followed the law regarding conflicts and that it does protect consumers. ---","Robert_Badeer_Aug2000Notes FoldersCal articles"

AND Gov. Davis Calls for Cut in Electricity Bills:","Deregulation: `Conspiracy of Incompetence Even if energy prices are being manipulated, it may not be illegalDavid Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer STATE -- Profit-hungry power companies may be manipulating California s electricity prices, industry insiders say, but the attorney general will have a tough time finding a smoking gun in his price-fixing probe. Even if he does prove that electricity generators are ``gaming   the market with a variety of price-influencing techniques, it s a whole other matter as to whether their actions violate the law. State legislators will attempt to shed some light on this murky matter during hearings today in Sacramento. What they will quickly discover is that power companies are having a field day as California muddles through deregulation of its electricity market. Among other things, power generators are said to be rigging electricity auctions and holding back juice until higher demand drives up wholesale prices, representing perhaps the single most glaring example of gaming, or price-fixing, the market. However, the generators aren t the only ones to blame for the current mess. ``This has literally been a conspiracy of incompetence,   said Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers  Action Network, a San Diego grass- roots organization. ``Almost every player has made major mistakes or a series of mistakes.   Utilities, he said, are also to blame for whopping price increases by mishandling power purchases. Meanwhile, state and federal regulators have demonstrated a virtually unwavering reluctance to weigh in and help stabilize electricity rates. At the same time, legislators themselves share some of the blame for California s energy woes by drafting rules for the deregulated market that are too easily bent, if not broken. ``All the market participants are taking advantage of very lax rules,   said Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission. ``The market is not competitive.   As a stopgap, Gov. Gray Davis yesterday called on the PUC to cut San Diego electricity prices in half over the next two years, although he was vague on how this can be accomplished. 1996 DEREGULATION When electricity deregulation was approved in 1996, the goal was to lower prices by boosting competition. In practice, however, only about a half-dozen power generators are now responsible for as much as three-quarters of the state s energy supply, and they can set prices pretty much as they see fit. Officials at the California Power Exchange, the wholesale market where power companies sell their juice and utilities go shopping, insist that they closely monitor all transactions. But they admit that it is impossible to know what may transpire among generators off the trading floor. ``There are hundreds of ways that somebody could do it,   exchange spokesman Jesus Arredondo said of whether price-fixing is possible. ``You could argue that it happens every day. ``But I don t see how you could call this gaming,   he said. ``You call it business.   There s the rub. Although residents of San Diego, the first California city to feel the full effects of deregulation, have seen average power bills more than double over the past three months, power generators say this is simply a result of supply and demand. SUPPLY LIMITED, DEMAND RISING With supply severely limited -- no major power plants have been built in the state in a decade -- and demand rapidly rising, it is only natural, they say, that electricity prices would go through the roof. ``It s a feast-or-famine business,   said Gary Ackerman, executive director of Menlo Park s Western Power Trading Forum, an energy industry group. ``You make a lot of money when times are good, and lose a lot of money when times are bad.   At the moment, times are very good for power generators. An unusually hot summer has combined with a booming, tech-fueled economy to push California s power grid nearly to the breaking point on an almost daily basis. The question is: Are power companies benefiting from what are, for them, lucky circumstances, or are they making a bad situation even worse with practices that may not be illegal but still could be viewed as highly irresponsible? FOUR WHOLESALE MARKETS There are four major wholesale markets for electricity in California. The biggest is called the daily forward market, where generators and utilities meet each morning to buy and sell power on an hour-by-hour basis covering the next 24 hours. Electricity at times of expected low demand, such as 1 a.m., might go for as little as $25 per megawatt, while electricity during peak demand -- 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. -- often sells for the maximum allowable amount, or $250 per megawatt. Longer-term contracts are negotiated on what is called the block forward market, where prices are more stable. But, industry sources say, power companies are increasingly focusing more on the hourly and real-time markets, where the potential for profit is greater than on the daily forward market because buyers have less room to maneuver -- they have to meet immediate demand. ``Of course people are gaming the market,   said Dan Richard, senior vice president of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. ``They know when to make bids and how to get what they want. Is that illegal? I honestly don t know.   Brian Rahman, who oversees the real-time wholesale market on behalf of the California Independent System Operator, agreed that the legality of such moves has yet to be determined. ``The power marketers know our rules,   he said, ``and they use them to their benefit.   Even so, Power Exchange officials said they will tell legislators today that their own study of wholesale electricity prices shows that California rates in June and July were in fact lower than in other states. ``This makes it harder to make a case that market power is being exerted by power generators,   said the exchange s Arredondo. ``It s exceedingly difficult to prove that there s market power.   NO HEDGING IN SAN DIEGO Meanwhile, San Diego Gas & Electric has been accused of adding to electricity price volatility in the Southern California city by not securing long-term contracts for energy at a steady rate -- a process known as ``hedging.   Instead, the utility exposed its customers to daily price spikes, which resulted in power bills surging skyward. ``San Diego is bearing the brunt (of deregulation) for a couple of reasons: poor hedging and poor hedging,   Arredondo said. For its part, PG&E has said it learned its lesson from San Diego and will make active use of hedging when its customers face the impact of deregulation, perhaps as soon as next summer. Davis called last week for Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate ``possible manipulation   in the wholesale electricity market. He also has asked federal regulators to rule that California s energy market is not competitive and to mandate ``just and reasonable   rates. But regulators at both the federal and state levels so far have been reluctant to act, preferring instead to allow deregulation to run its course. For all these reasons, California s energy market has been especially vulnerable to exploitation by those who may not have consumers  best interests at heart. ``The system of responsibility is fragmented,   the PUC s Lynch said, ``and because it is fragmented, it allows various players to game the market.   WHAT CAN BE DONE The solution? It depends who you ask. Most of those on the energy playing field believe that some degree of regulation is necessary to stabilize electricity prices, but no one yet knows how far legislators should go in drafting revised rules. Increased generating capacity will go a long way toward solving California s problems, but it will be years before enough new plants come online to bring supply and demand into balance. Today s hearings in Sacramento will presumably lay the groundwork for future initiatives. Although few if anyone knows how to fix things, everyone at least agrees that something -- anything -- needs to be done. ``Government messes things up a lot of times, and the private sector messes things up a lot of times,   said PG&E s Richard. ``But in the end, solutions emerge because it s just too important. That s the case now.

Davis Calls for Cut in Electricity BillsPUC under no obligation to heed unclear request David Lazarus, Lynda Gledhill, Greg Lucas, Chronicle Staff WritersThursday, August 10, 2000 ,2000 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/08/10/BU99453.DTL&type=business Gov. Gray Davis yesterday called on the California Public Utilities Commission to cut soaring San Diego electricity bills in half during the next two years. However, it was not clear how he expects the PUC to accomplish this goal or whether the commission will even heed the governor s request. Davis does not have the authority to order the PUC to act. ``This is not a rate freeze,   Davis told reporters in Sacramento. ``It is a rate-stabilization plan.   It appears that what he has in mind is having San Diego Gas & Electric, the local utility, level out power bills by spreading its wholesale costs over longer periods. This would reduce customers  bills in the summer but raise bills at other times of the year. ``This is an oraclelike document,   Michael Shames, executive director of San Diego s Utility Consumers  Action Network, said after reading a press release outlining the governor s position. ``You can read almost anything into it.   Calling electricity prices in San Diego exorbitant, Davis said he wants the PUC to reduce average residential power bills from the current level of about $120 a month to approximately $65. ``Electricity is the pulse of our economy,   he said. ``Without it, consumers and businesses are put at risk. California simply cannot afford any more price spikes or blackouts.   Carl Wood, a Davis appointee on the PUC, said he believes the governor is seeking a so-called level pricing program for SDG&E customers. The PUC is empowered to order the utility to implement such a program. The utility itself already is urging ratepayers to adopt a similar pricing plan, thereby paying consistent electricity fees throughout the year. ``We can t make the prices go away, but we can set up a system where the prices are level and deferred,   Wood said. PUC President Loretta Lynch said she will call a special meeting of the commission for August 21 to discuss the governor s proposal. Davis  comments came ahead of a joint hearing today at 10 a.m. on California s energy woes by the Senate and Assembly utilities committees in the Capitol Building. Also today, state Sen. Dede Alpert, D-Coronado (San Diego County), and Assemblywoman Susan Davis, D-Kensington, are expected to introduce identical bills seeking to roll back electricity rates in San Diego to prederegulation levels. ``We appreciate what the governor has done, but we feel there needs to be a parallel track in the Legislature where we find a solution for San Diego ratepayers,   Alpert said. The governor said he will contact President Clinton and James Hoecker, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, to urge them to expedite an investigation of California s wholesale electricity market. He also has called on Attorney General Bill Lockyer to probe suspected price fixing by power generators. ``I believe in making a profit,   Davis said. ``I believe in success. But charging seven, eight, nine times the price you pay for electricity is simply unconscionable. It s not fair to California. It will bring down our economy, and it augers very poorly for America.   Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy said it may sail to the rescue in San Diego by bringing in its own electricity- generating equipment to keep its extensive bases in the area humming. The Navy is SDG&E s single biggest customer, drawing about 3 percent of the utility s total output. The Navy said in a statement that it is looking into transporting 10 750-kilowatt generators from its facility in Port Heuneme to San Diego. For its part, the California Grocers Association said its members will reduce electricity usage by 10 percent during periods of unusually heavy demand. This could include lowering store lighting and cutting air conditioning at some supermarkets. ``Although consumers may notice some differences while in their local supermarket, the energy-saving measures will not affect normal store operations,   said Peter Larkin, president of the association. ``Also, none of these measures will have a negative impact on food safety or quality.

The facility has the track, and room to off-load up to 90 rail cars at one time if necessary. There are three tracks running in parallel, with each track holding 30 cars each. Currently none of the track is being used. With this capacity, the need for storage will be minimal if any, but there is more than enough room to build storage if necessary. As Bob stated, on this property there is two PG&E gas lines, Mohave gas line, the 30\" El Paso Natural gas line also passes through the site. The High pressure Socal gas line does not appear to pass through the property but must be in the area somewhere, as the plant purchases gas to operate there heaters from Socal.  If any or all the company s who have lines in the area, PG&E, Mohave, El Paso, Socal, are interested in this project, this site is ideal. Paramount Refining is very receptive as the rail rack is currently not in service.Who knows how much gas flows through this area? To give you some idea, this site is located on the 15 highway just south of the town Mohave. The ROW for the El Paso gas line (All American) passes through the site and crosses the 15 headed West.

I have met with several groups in ENA Development, and the potential for a fuel switching facility is attracting a lot of attention.  They initially considered the 20 MW portable unit, but now think there may be more value with a 40 to 50 MW unit.  The opportunity to generate more power using the fuel advantage caught their eye.  The current scheme is to site the facility at the Tupman plant, provide EOTT steam and power at a reduced cost, ENA market the electricity, and EOT participate in the revenue of power sale.  This has the advantage of controlled energy cost for the plant, participation in the revenue stream, and limited capital outlay for EOTT.  The downside would be lack of control of the merchant power activity, and it would be a permanent facility.  I am also assuming permitting and emissions compliance issues would not be extraordinary.There will be a longer construction time, but I stressed to ENA that a new boiler would need to be built first in anticipation of the generator, and then it could be incorporated when available.

Ideally, the plant would inject / vaporize normal butane at the rate of 18,750 gallons per hour into a high pressure natural gas transmission system.Current gas pipeline specs are as follows:	Operating pressure - 850 - 1000 psig, worst case 750, normal range 800-900	Gas Volume - 650,000 - 750,000 MMBtu/day		Expected normal butane (GPA spec) requirement - 450,000 gallons/day (18,750 gal/ per hour)My questions are:1) Is anyone currently using butanes for peaking service and if so, where?2)  Do we need to blend with air (how much) or can we inject straight normal butane?3)  At what line pressure point do the butanes re-liquefy further downstream of the injection point as the pipeline pressure falls?4)  Is this peaking plant configuration feasible and if so, at what price (ball park here, don t go way out of your way)?  (If it s not, what would your suggestion be for a design).I will fax you the normal butane specs as soon as I get them (please email back your fax number).As always, we re on a pretty tight time frame.

The facility has the track, and room to off-load up to 90 rail cars at one time if necessary. There are three tracks running in parallel, with each track holding 30 cars each. Currently none of the track is being used. With this capacity, the need for storage will be minimal if any, but there is more than enough room to build storage if necessary. As Bob stated, on this property there is two PG&E gas lines, Mohave gas line, the 30\" El Paso Natural gas line also passes through the site. The High pressure Socal gas line does not appear to pass through the property but must be in the area somewhere, as the plant purchases gas to operate there heaters from Socal.  If any or all the company s who have lines in the area, PG&E, Mohave, El Paso, Socal, are interested in this project, this site is ideal. Paramount Refining is very receptive as the rail rack is currently not in service.Who knows how much gas flows through this area? To give you some idea, this site is located on the 15 highway just south of the town Mohave. The ROW for the El Paso gas line (All American) passes through the site and crosses the 15 headed West.

CEO Hal Kvisle.TransCanada is a joint partner in Foothills with Vancouver-based WestcoastEnergy, which is in the process of being taken over by Duke Energy.Foothills has U.S. and Canadian regulatory permits dating from 1977 to buildthe Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System, which would run through Alaskaalong the highway into western Canada and ultimately into the lower-48states. The new proposal is to build a 42- or 48-inch-diameter pipeline from theNorth Slope, Kvisle said, across the Yukon and Alberta and into thecontinental U.S., with initial deliveries of about 2.5 billion cubic feetper day. The three major North Slope producers have said the existingproposal-a 1,700-mile pipeline with capacity for 4 billion cubicfeet/day-would cost $17.2 billion.The three North Slope producers-ExxonMobil, BP and PhillipsPetroleum-testified at a Senate hearing this fall that the economics of anyAlaska-to-lower-48 pipeline were questionable. Kvisle said he hopes asmaller project will persuade the producers to give early backing to theengineering phase and, in the process, see how gas supply and demandunfolds.The dramatic drop in wellhead gas prices this year has fueled concerns thata pipeline from Alaska is no longer economical, Kvisle noted. Still, afterexamining various pipeline options, the North Slope producers appear to beleaning more toward the Alaska Highway route than they were before, he said.Read the entire story at http://www.energyinsight.com.

The producers told Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles  natural gas development team at a meeting last week in Anchorage that the project looks like a long shot at best. The proposed pipeline would yield a rate of return on investment of about 10-11%, far less than the 15% sought by the producers. Neither the Alaska Highway route nor the Mackenzie Delta route would provide attractive enough returns to justify the enormous up-front costs associated with such a massive construction project, according to preliminary analysis by the producers. The Alaska Highway Route, which is favored by state legislators because it would bring in more tax dollars, provide in-state jobs and have less environmental impact would cost about $17.2 billion. The significantly shorter route under the Beaufort Sea and south through Canada s McKenzie River valley would cost about $15.1 billion, the companies said, according to the report. Exxon, Phillips and BP are still examining their findings but clearly consider the project a long shot. Nevertheless, they are still willing to examine potential cost cutting measures, such as reducing construction costs and streamlining the permitting process to avoid delays. \"Despite how some of the press are portraying it -- that the producers have scrapped the idea (the Canadian press was writing the obituary on the Alaska highway gas line yesterday) -- reports of its demise are greatly exaggerated, to borrow a phrase,\" said Knowles spokesman Bob King. \"Actually I think there is some good news in what they said. They talked about the project not meeting their goal of a 15% rate of return, but they did say it was profitable. In fact, they said it would provide a 10-11% rate of return. I think that portends well for the project. \"There s still a challenge and there are issues to be dealt with to make this project more economic,\" King added. \"There are some steps the state can take to address some of the risk, but I think the fact that their projection that the gas line is profitable bodes well for the project. They didn t say this project is over. There still is a tremendous resource that is there. There s still a tremendous national need.\" The governor is going to be in Washington, DC, this week to testify Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing. \"He ll talk about his proposals, which include some financial incentives in terms of investment tax credits and the like in order to help make this project economically viable,\" King said. \"He s also mentioned accelerated depreciation and also some potential tax credits if gas prices turn south.\" King noted the governor and the Alaska legislature are still vehemently opposed to the Mackenzie Delta route. Alaska has passed a law essentially blocking that route. \"The governor has always supported the Alaska Highway route. He thinks the over-the-top route is a nonstarter. There are too many logistical and environmental concerns that I don t think can ever be resolved in order for it to happen. There is a lot of opposition within the state from the Eskimos who depend on the Beaufort Sea for subsistence whale hunting. They ve made it very clear that they would strongly challenge any such project even though this is a group that is very supportive of responsible development on the Slope. They want to make sure it s done in an acceptable manner, one that doesn t threaten their traditional lifestyles.\" Another main criteria is making sure that Alaskans have access to the gas itself, King added. The over-the-top route would bypass the Alaska market entirely. \"That s clearly not acceptable.\"","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinProjectsTsunami"

Tony Knowles who has pinned the remainder of his term toward getting an Alaska Highway natural gas pipeline, major producers indicated this week that because the cost would be less, they now favor a North Slope pipeline that would move north, through the Beaufort Sea, instead of across the state. Ken Konrad, a BP executive, testifying during two days of hearings before the Alaska legislature s Joint Committee on Natural Gas Pipelines, told the committee that an analysis \"so far indicates that the northern route appears more cost efficient than a southern route.\" Konrad also noted that with a Beaufort line, gas reserves in the Mackenzie River delta also could be taken -- which would be a major victory for Canadian officials. Konrad and other stakeholders, including producers, analysts and government officials involved in moving gas from the North Slope, were asked to speak before the joint committee and offer their insight on where the project could be headed.  BP and partners Exxon Mobil and Phillips Petroleum, the majority property rights  holders on the North Slope, have been analyzing various routes for a proposed pipe since last fall, which basically would either move supply across the state or go north under the Beaufort Sea and into Canada on a trek toward the Lower 48. The producer consortium, the North American Natural Gas Pipeline Group, is spending close to $100 million to evaluate the routes and has indicated it could file an application on one of the routes with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) by the end of this year. Konrad s testimony, as well as comments made during the hearings, indicate that the desire of Alaska officials to keep the pipe inside the state may fall apart. What appears to be the deal maker or breaker is cost. Konrad said only \"a few dimes\" separate the two major proposals, but transportation costs per thousand Btus would pick up savings in lower investment costs with a shorter pipe and lower operating costs. Economists have estimated the rate for bringing gas to the Lower 48 from the North Slope will be around $2.25/MMBtu. A shorter pipe overall would lead to substantial savings, especially on a project that Konrad noted faces serious challenges economically. Joe Maruschack, Phillips  natural gas pipeline chief, said his group is aware of the \"deep reservations\" Alaskan officials have about a Beaufort route, but also indicated that problems associated with the Beaufort route could be risky as well. He cited environmental opposition from aboriginal groups, which would have to approve the routing, construction on a sea route, logistical challenges and additional permitting as part of a daunting, and lengthy task. If the consortium and other producers chose the Beaufort route, Maruschack indicated that they could explore some way to bring gas to Alaska s residents south of the North Slope. But in Alaska, it s about more than the supply. This past spring the Alaska legislature, with strong support from Knowles, passed a law to prevent construction of a Beaufort route (see Daily GPI, March 30 <d20010330d.html>). Without Alaska s support, the Beaufort route could also face defeat. \"We re coming to a divergence,\" said Harold Heinze, the former Alaska Natural Resources Department commissioner and a former energy executive. \"There s a big difference between maximizing the profitability of companies and maximizing the benefit to the state.\" Ken Thompson, a former Atlantic Richfield executive and president of Arco Alaska Inc., said one compromise would be to offer tax breaks for building along the Alaska Highway. \"They could pressure the governor and the legislature to make a deal,\" he told the committee. Roger Marks, a State of Alaska oil and gas economist who has studied the proposed projects, said the cost savings could be as much as $2 billion using the Beaufort route, which would be about 200 miles shorter than an Alaska Highway route. Total construction costs, according to Konrad, now range between $15 billion and $20 billion. \"Several dimes from your transportation costs could remove a lot of risks,\" Marks told the committee. Meanwhile, Alaska remains committed to getting a pipe through the state. Foothills Pipe Lines Alaska Inc. signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the state on Thursday to complete its review of the Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co. s previously filed right-of-way lease application to construct and operate the highway pipe. Foothills constructed what exists so far of the Alaska gas line and remains a proponent of the trans-Alaska route. U.S. and Canadian law has designated the ANNGTC, a partnership of Foothills and TransCanada PipeLines, to construct and operate the Alaska portion. Foothills and its affiliates would construct and operate the Canadian portion. \"This agreement is an important step in completing our land position for this project,\" said John Ellwood, Foothills vice president. \"Together with 400 miles of right-of-way we have on federal lands in Alaska and our extensive right-of-way in Canada, we are in an excellent position to expedite the building of the pipe.\" Ellwood said the application review, together with the existing permits and FERC and National Energy Board of Canada certificates, underlines the timing advantage of a trans-Alaska route advocated by Foothills and its shareholder companies, Westcoast Energy and TransCanada. \"One thing that everyone in Washington (DC) and Anchorage agree on is that getting North Slope gas to the Lower 48 is a priority, and our approved route along the Alaska Highway through Canada can deliver that gas two-to-three years earlier than any greenfield project,\" Ellwood said. \"We have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to advance this project and that has enhanced our ability to deliver Alaska gas to the Lower 48.\"","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinProjectsTsunami"

He also cautioned that producers will have to have the Alaskan government s blessing on the chosen route, or it would be a \"fatal flaw in the process.\" Small, who will testify next week before the Alaska State Legislature s Joint Committee on Natural Gas Pipelines, said Thursday that instead of making it easier to build the pipe, politics seem to actually be making it more difficult now than ever before. Besides the political climate, which pits Alaska s elected leaders against Alberta s -- where the pipe would be laid under one proposal, Small also sees a two-fold problem on the supply side. \"On the demand side, when high prices showed, demand went down, and probably will not come back like it did before,\" he said. \"The economy slowing down has helped in the perception of weakness and demand softness.\" Of the predictions that the North American gas demand will reach 30 Tcf in the next 20 years, Small said that CERA analysts had \"never been a proponent of a 30 Tcf world, and now it s less plausible than probable.\" That in itself will lower expectations of an Alaska pipeline, he said. Part of the demand problem is actually laying the pipe, and Small pointed to the infrastructure it will take, which he said will require no stopping once it really begins. \"If you overlay the reality of the world, to bring the kind of supply to make it worthwhile from Alaska would require a huge infrastructure, which I don t see happening by 2007. Maybe 2010, or maybe 2015, but it s just so huge.\" The second part of the dilemma facing an Alaskan pipeline is the incredible growth in the liquefied natural gas market, which has seen an enormous amount of activity from both majors and independents since the beginning of this year (see related story). \"LNG is going to be competition to Alaskan gas,\" Small said. \"The demand problem has brought out a lot of potential responses, and LNG is one of them. It has changed the landscape, and so it changes the outlook for the pipe.\" While he said that the economics are actually comparable from Arctic gas and new greenfield LNG facilities, \"LNG can be different on a scale regarding the cost and it has more of an environmental footprint than a 3,500-mile gas pipeline.\" However, not all of the LNG announcements made thus far will be completed, Small noted. \"As projects are announced, it s what s going to be built that puts the actual question into Arctic gas.\" Despite what he called his \"realistic\" rather than \"negative\" attitude toward the pipe, Small said that laying it will be such a \"monumental undertaking that it may develop a life of its own regardless. The need for gas may be more than adequate to overcome any obstacles.\" However, he cautioned that the obstacles were only getting higher. \"Alaska has drawn a line in the sand, and without getting into the legality of that, what that does is set the tone,\" Small said of the Alaska legislature and Gov. Tony Knowles moving to ensure the pipe is built the way the state wants it built, regardless.  Meanwhile, Alberta also has sort of drawn a line in the sand, Small said, which is important, because at least one-third of the pipeline would move through the province. \"From the sheer cost of it, it doesn t need any obstacles,\" he said. \"Those kinds of things are stumbling blocks.\" Besides the government officials working to ensure they not upset constituents, Small said there also are the rights-of-way that have to be obtained and a lot of other work to be done behind the scenes. \"At this juncture, it s in the producers hands, and they say they will make a decision by the end of the year, but I m skeptical of that,\" he said. \"It doesn t mean it won t be built. But if (the producers  route decision) is contrary to the Alaskan government, it may be a fatal flaw in the entire process.\" The key, he said, is in the economies of scale. \"The bigger they make it, the more impact it will have on the market. A huge pipeline would have a huge impact on the market.\" In his opinion, the total pipeline s capacity, which includes Alaska, the Mackenzie Delta supplies and any LNG facilities built, would be a \"maximum of 4 Bcf/d.\"","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinProjectsTsunami"

After carrying an estimated C$40 billion worth (US$27 billion) of exports to the United States in the past 20 years, the \"prebuild\" of the Alaska pipeline, completed by Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd., predicts that far from losing, Canadians stand to gain if the country can build the missing northern link in the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System (ANGTS). Permanent benefits for all Canadian users of the pipeline grid are projected by Foothills co-CEOs Michael Stewart and Dennis McConaghy. Stewart is executive vice-president for business development for Westcoast Energy Inc. and McConaghy is his counterpart at TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. Foothills remains the sole owner of ANGTS s sponsor, Alaska Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co., after nine U.S. partners in the original 1970s version of the project dropped out during its long dormant spell. In an interview, Stewart called Foothills a pipeline counterpart to \"the little engine that could,\" referring to the old children s story book. \"Except it s not so little,\" he said. Initially installed as an early start on southern legs in the mega-project in order to help finance the far costlier northern section, Foothills now carries about 35% of Canadian gas exports. Stewart described the reviving prospects of completing ANGTS as a further service -- this time in \"optimizing\" use of the Canadian pipeline grid. McConaghy believes that by completing the missing northern link, Canada would benefit, and Foothills has taken that case to the National Energy Board (NEB). The arrival of Alaskan gas into the 3.3 Bcf/d Foothills system would allow Canadian production to move over to TransCanada and Westcoast without forcing them to fight the new Alliance Pipeline and associated eastern links, the Vector and proposed Millennium systems. As a result,Canadians would shed the burden of costs associated with excess capacity that has emerged as a result of aggressive pipeline construction since the mid-1990s. Capacity grew so much that Natural Resources Canada estimates refilling the routes to the Lower 48 will require exports from the western provinces of about 3.8 Tcf/year - - or nearly one-third more than early-1990s industry planners estimated the region s gas fields could support on a sustained basis. Despite production increases generated by a record drilling pace over the past year, McConaghy estimated that the pipeline grid still has 1.5-2 Bcf of excess daily capacity. That poses a problem of \"defraying fixed costs,\" in his words. The problem drives an application by TransCanada to the NEB for a raise in its effective rate of return to 12.5% from 9.6%. The hike is sought to cover costs of lost traffic and compensate for increased business risks posed by the glutted, competitive Canadian market for gas-transportation services. Potentially long, hard-fought hearings are planned into how much of a raise to allow and how to translate it into toll increases for shippers still bound to use TransCanada by long delivery contracts. TransCanada has told the NEB it does not expect the cost pressure to end any time soon, if ever. At current gas discovery, sales and reserves depletion rates, TransCanada projects that the production capability of the entire Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin is liable to peak and slip into decline within eight to 13 years. Some of the strain is expected to originate within the Canadian petroleum industry as it turns increasingly for its oil supplies to heavy crude and the oil sands, employing gas-fired heat extraction processes. Use of gas by oil sands mining complexes is projected to triple by 2010 to 590 MMcf/d from 190 MMcf/d. Gas use by heavy-oil operations is expected to grow almost as fast, to 730 MMcf/d in 2010 from 270 MMcf/d. Gas-fired power generation in western Canada, which is also associated with industrial expansion, is forecast to consume 980 MMcf/d by 2010, compared to 490 MMcf/d last year. When will Alaskan gas arrive to take some of the pressure off western Canadian supplies? Foothills estimates it will take five years from the time when a decision is made to go ahead on building the northern connection. That includes two years of planning, securing transportation contracts, procuring materials and satisfying regulatory and environmental requirements, followed by three years of construction. Stewart and McConaghy are not predicting when the decision to go ahead will be made, although they are continuing to advance the mega-project through preliminaries such as nailing down rights-of-way. The Foothills CEOs expect no more than hints to emerge about when the talk about the northern revival will turn into action from hearings in Anchorage, before a natural gas pipelines committee set up by the Alaska State Legislature July 17 and 18.They expect a key element -- a plan by the owners of Prudhoe Bay gas, BP, Exxon Mobil and Phillips Petroleum -- to take much longer to come together. Current schedules for their feasibility studies indicate it will take until the end of the year for the reports to be completed, then as much as six months longer for corporate decisions on whether to proceed to development, with BP and Exxon Mobil making comparisons between Alaskan prospects and the rest of their global inventories of projects. Foothills suggests that the northern planning exercise is evolving into a \"two-pipeline world\" and reports that it is going beyond its ANGTS interests to try to get in on proposals for a Mackenzie Valley line. Stewart and McConaghy expect markets for gas and transportation capacity to decide which line to build when, although they add that governments can make a big difference with decisions on items such as passing on delivery costs to consumers. The Foothills executives predict Canada will honor the treaty that created ANGTS if the Alaskan project is revived.","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinProjectsTsunami"

Is your group primary on the project now, or do I continue to send to someone else?  Let me know.  Arctic Resources Gains Key Aboriginal Support for Northern Pipe Arctic Resources Co., the upstart that only last year entered the myriad of pipeline proposals to move northern gas into the Lower 48, moved a few steps closer to fulfilling its dream of building a pipeline from Alaska s Prudhoe Bay to Edmonton, AB, last week by earning the endorsement of key Canadian aboriginal leaders. The cornerstone of ARC s approach is to build a consortium of political, producer, transportation and regional leaders; without aboriginal support, the plan would never succeed. However, Bob Murphy, point man for Houston-based ARC, said Friday that if all continues to go well, \"gas could be flowing by 2006.\" Last week, aboriginal leaders representing the Sahtu landowners and the Alberta First Nations agreed to endorse the project, including its approach to providing pipeline management by aboriginal and Native American groups involved in the governance of the project.  The Deh Cho, said Murphy, who also occupy a significant portion of the land through which a pipeline will travel, are now considering the proposal, and Murphy said he was optimistic. \"Together, Sahtu and Deh Cho lands represent over 70% of the land in the Northwest Territories, through which a pipeline would travel,\" he said. Gaining aboriginal support is key to any pipeline to the Lower 48, he said. ARC s Northern Gas Pipeline Project would create a natural gas pipeline extending from Prudhoe Bay in Alaska through and under the Beaufort Sea, coming onshore in northern Canada and extending through the Mackenzie River Valley to interconnects in Edmonton. Following a ramp-up period, ARC estimates it would transport 4 Bcf/d through the high-pressure 1,200 mile, fully entrenched route. The pipeline would cost $4 billion, and financing and reserves would add another $1 billion to the cost, which would be 100% debt financed. The debt financing would lower the tariffs, making it attractive to shippers, promoters say. Murphy said he s hopeful that by the end of the year, ARC could begin its pre-application permitting process, but he added there was still much to be accomplished. \"The ARC approach is all inclusive,\" Murphy told NGI. \"We fully intend to gain the support of all of the parties because we are offering a balanced approach to project management. We believe our approach is far more than just a route. That s important to understand. Our approach offers the least expensive, the lowest tariff,\" he said. \"Politically, we have to take care of Canadian interests. We have to take care of the political issues in Canada, and that includes bringing the aboriginal regions in. You have to do that to succeed.\" ARC s proactive approach combines Canadian aboriginal and Native American interests that line the pipeline route with an independent business consortium under the company s umbrella, Murphy said. The balance of interests of the competing stakeholders offers the type of business discipline \"that will be required by the capital markets and industry.\" What ARC gained last week was a Framework Memorandum, executed by the Ernie MacDonald Land Corp. (EMLC), one of six Sahtu landowners whose territory would be crossed by the pipeline. The memorandum was structured to include participation of other aboriginal landowners following briefings in their communities. The Fort Norman Metis Land Corp. also agreed to join EMLC as a signatory to the memorandum. EMLC President Larry Tourangeau said that he believed the \"interests of Canada, the United States, industry, the environment and aboriginal people are best served by an initial single, cost-effective pipeline that connects both northern Canada and Alaska to southern markets without damaging either Canadian or Alaskan resources.\" What EMLC also likes, and what Murphy hopes ARC can convince other aboriginal leaders of as well, is that ARC will give the affected aboriginal regions control over the pipeline --- an approach not used by other competing proposals. \"We believe that aboriginal ownership and involvement, as proposed in the ARC approach, will improve the prospects for a safe, timely and economic project,\" said Tourangeau. ARC Chairman Forrest Hoglund, who spearheaded the efforts of former Exxon Corp. in its unfulfilled plans to build a natural gas pipeline from Alaska almost 30 years ago, said the endorsement of aboriginal leaders \"marks a major milestone to getting to the right answer quickly on this important project.\" He called the \"one pipeline approach with aboriginal support\" the \"fastest, lowest cost, best environmental and best political approach\" for the region. Now it s on to gaining more support, and beginning the critical step of establishing a special purpose committee, Murphy said. The SPC would be organized and created under Canadian law and owned by certain aboriginal groups whose lands the pipeline crosses. Similar provisions would be offered for the Alaskan region, he said. Murphy said ARC is now working with the producers interested in an Alaskan pipeline, as well as political leaders in Canada and Washington, DC. When asked how producer involvement was going, Murphy said the companies were \"doing the type of work anyone would need to do\" to study which option would be best for their companies. \"At the same time, we re certainly hopeful that they re going to want to perceive this route as the far more economical one and the one with the best political approach,\" Murphy said. \"Of course, the economics of the project matter, but politics matter too. Pipelines have to work economically and not just at $9 gas. This is a long-term project, and we ve put a great deal of emphasis on the business sense of it.\" ARC s proposal is not the only one on the drawing board, but so far, none have gotten further than the proposal stage. No applications have been applied for yet by any of the competing proposals, which include two other major proposals: The Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System (ANGTS): The ANGTS was approved in September 1977 by President Jimmy Carter and the U.S. Congress. The proposal envisions a 5,000-mile joint U.S.-Canadian overland pipeline that would deliver up to 2.5 Bcf/d to the Lower 48. Portions of ANGTS already have been completed, with more than 2,600 miles along two legs from Alberta into the United States. The statutory framework between Canada and the United States also still exists. However, this project has languished and environmental reviews still have not been completed. Costs for the unbuilt segments range between $7-$11 billion. The Central Pipeline Route would follow the ANGTS to just below the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, then travel southeast through the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge into the Northwest Territories and south into the Mackenzie River Valley into Alberta. This has languished mostly because of environmental protests of the route and less political support.","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinProjectsTsunami"

Both a land-based and floating terminal are being considered, according to Sempra s CEO Stephen Baum, whose company already has proposals to build a 600-MW power plant at Mexicali and a 212-mile natural gas pipeline from the Arizona-California border through northern Baja to serve power plants along the way and south of the border city of Tijuana. The estimated cost of the LNG receiving terminal is $350 million. Mexican officials reportedly are expecting to have one or two LNG facilities built in Baja in the years to come. The strong interest in LNG among U.S. and European energy giants is prompted by natural gas price spikes in the past 12 and the prospects for prices staying at the $3.50-$4/MM-Btu level. Baum said Sempra has concluded that the long-term prospect for gas prices staying around the $4 level is good enough to make an LNG project financially viable. A number of industry analysts are skeptical citing the risk and the siting/permitting hurdles that developers will face even in Mexico, let alone in California, as some proponents have suggested. Because of its geographic proximity and number of successful projects permitted by the Mexican government, Sempra is expected to have a leg up on competition, and Baum and other Sempra officials are betting on that edge holding up. Although none of the participants are still around, a part of Sempra s Southern California Gas Co. utility in the late 1970s pursued an LNG receiving terminal along the southern California coast west of Santa Barbara. That project was to bring in the equivalent of 500 MMcf/d gas in the form of LNG from Indonesia through a joint venture of affiliates of SoCalGas and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Even with special state legislation to streamline the permitting process for the controversial receiving terminal, the project died from lack of permitting approvals, seismic concerns and ultimately changing economics that killed the project. Utility ratepayers ultimately paid millions of dollars for the aborted project in the early 1980s. During the same period, parts of El Paso had a disastrous experience with plans to bring in LNG from Algeria and other areas to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast.","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinProjectsTsunami"

One problem I see is that the mileages and the capital in the presentation don t match.  The $822 mm seems to match a case with 175 miles of mainline rather than 239.Arnold and Ron Matthews had already tentatively scheduled a get-together tomorrow to work on optimization and to get the facilities and the estimates on the same page.Mike Smith mentioned that looks like the Indian ROW renewal will cost about $80mm in todays dollars, $40mm in ten years, remainder in 20.  Not sure what a reasonable escalator is to use for reservations.Regarding Bush  tarriff.  I would not assume that there is enuf contingency and escalation to cover the increase.  The escalation is there to cover normal inflation of material and construction costs and the contingency is there to cover the incompleteness in scoping at the time of the estimate preparation.  (Rand Corp some years back did an extensive study of estimates ex contingency versus final costs and confirmed that primarily due to insufficient scoping details, a seemingly large level of contingency was required to cover the actual costs.   When a project is a gleam in someone s eye, probably need 25%, by the time you are starting construction - maybe 5%.)Also James C. sent me a copy of his baseline model.  I have a relatively quick and dirty model I use for preliminary analyses and for roughly the same assumptions we ended up in about the same place - about 5.5% IRR on equity. Bear in mind that this included no increases in volumes over time, no incremental Row payments and no payoff at the end of 20 years.  Another point.  Will you really be able to sell the 540 at 45 cents (plus a bush tarriff kicker) 100% 365 days a year?That s all for now.

The Staff Recommendation is not yet available.SummaryAs noted in yesterday s email, Staff is recommending the following generalprinciples:-  The Commission convert El Paso s Full Requirements service (FR) toContract Demand service (CD)- Allocation of CD be based on the greater of (1) a shipper s billingdeterminants from the 1996 settlement, or (2) coincidental peak (ashipper s own usage) based on demand on Sept. 12, 2001- The Commission assign specific receipt point rights to shippers based onEl Paso s proposed 20 pooling point configuration- A technical conference be convened, that may include attendance by theCommissioners, on the Staff recommendationsBackgroundStaff recounted the issue on El Paso s system, including the question to bedecided by the Commission: has El Paso s FR service become unjust andunreasonable?  Staff believes it has, and explains that it is within theCommission s jurisdiction to allocate El Paso s capacity in order to:      (1) restore system flexibility      (2) end uncertainty (in the form of pro rata capacity cuts) of firmdelivery      (3) ensure full & fair utilization of El Paso s systemAccording to Staff s presentation, the problems on El Paso s system are dueto changes in system load since the pipeline s 1996 settlement.  A majorincrease in CD load and the sale of all unsubscribed capacity since 1996(which was nearly one half unsold at that time) has changed the operationsand capacity availability on El Paso, resulting in frequent capacityconstraints on the system.  This problem is aggravated by the settlement sresultant rate freeze, which impedes any economic incentive for El Paso toexpand or upgrade its system.Recommendations (Bob Petrocelli presenting)Staff recommends that the Commission convert FR to CD, while maintaining(1) the existing rate structure from the 1996 settlement, and 2) a smallamount of FT-2 FR contracts (for small customers, such as municipalities),with an overall cap on the rate schedule.  This will \"balance the interestsof all shippers and restore firm service on the El Paso system.\"  Also, itwill send the proper price signals for system expansions.In comments on this and related proceedings, shippers have recommended fourallocation methods for the converted CD:      (1) 1996 settlement bid determinants      (2) system peak (coincidental demand)      (3) individual peak (non-coincidental demand)      (4) some combo of the aboveStaff recommends utilizing the greater of #1 or #2 (using Sept. 12, 2001,as benchmark demand day).  This reflects current usage mitigated by thesettlement capacity contracts.Staff also recommends the Commission assign specific receipt point rights,using El Paso s proposed expanded 20 pool system [in this proposal, El Pasonarrows its current six pools in three basin areas to 20 geographic pools].As support of this recommendation, Staff noted:      (1) it is consistent with the Commission s one-time delivery pointallocation in BR/Amoco/Topock complaint case      (2) gives certainty for supply to all shippers      (3) enhances the tradeability of capacity      (4) eliminates daily pro rata curtailments in the basinCommissioners  DiscussionPat Wood:  He noted that 10-year settlements are far too prospective andwill never be approved by him.  Whether the Staff recommendation is thebest fix is the question that will be explored in the technical conference.Chairman Wood also asked how the economic incentive to expand will bedifferent -- Staff answered that in 1995 the settlement s intent was tokeep the system viable at all, and changes are needed to move to next step.Wood also noted that \"this wouldn t have happened if El Paso had compliedwith Order 636 -- it s a lesson on the power side that we not carve outexceptions.\"Nora Brownell:  Brownell asked questions about the current infrastructure,how the takeaway capacity at Topock is being handled, and if this addressesfuture capacity needs.  Staff responded that this is \"an economic fix tothe current disincentives for El Paso expansions,\" and that there areproposals out there to address future capacity and takeaway needs.Bill Massey: Stated that the current situation is \"intolerable\" and thatStaff s presentation persuaded him that their plan is reasonable because\"bold Commission action is necessary here.\"Linda Breathitt:  She asked if there are any other interstate pipelinesusing FR service, and was told no, only some intrastate municipalitiesstill utilize FR on a commodity demand basis.(See attached file: G-1March13.ppt)===================Nancy BagotManager, Govt.

The project, to be constructed in two 500-megawatt phases, is= a water-cooled power plant using a maximum of 6,000 acre-feet of groundwat=er per year when both units are operating continuously at full output. Sout=hWestern Power Group II is the project developer. The approval requires Sou=thWestern to install solar technology when they begin building the second p=ower block. This is the first merchant power plant that is required to inco=rporate solar technology as a core part of the total project. Merchant powe=r plants supply power to the wholesale market as opposed to power plants bu=ilt by a utility with the primary objective of serving its own customers. D=uring Tuesday s meeting, the Commission accepted the 22 restrictions placed= on the project by the Arizona Power Plant and Transmission Line Siting Com=mittee. After hearing from several representatives of the Bowie and Willcox= communities, the Commissioners approved an amendment offered by Commission=er Spitzer. The Spitzer amendment specifically addresses concerns by nearby= pistachio farmers that groundwater pumping could affect the surrounding wa=ter table. Summary of the Spitzer Amendment: The amendment requires SouthWe=stern Power Group II to establish and pay for a groundwater monitoring prog=ram that meets Arizona Department of Water Resources criteria. Once the pro=ject is operating, the SouthWestern will have to establish and make annual =contributions of $100,000 to a Groundwater Impact Mitigation Fund until the= fund reaches a balance of $500,000. Any business or individual who can pro=ve, through successful arbitration, that groundwater pumping has caused pro=perty or economic damage will be able to submit a claim for reimbursement. =SouthWestern will be required to maintain a total balance of $500,000 in th=e fund. Status reports on the program are to be filed with the Town of Bowi=e, the Pistachio Pass Irrigation District and the Cochise County Board of S=upervisors. The Groundwater Impact Mitigation Fund must be maintained for t=hree years after the plant ceases operation and is decommissioned. Commissi=oner Marc Spitzer said the amendment was prudent considering that the lasti=ng impact of the power project. \"I proposed this amendment to answer the co=ncerns of the pistachio farmers and the irrigation district,\" Commissioner =Marc Spitzer said. \"Although we heard testimony that the power plant s grou=ndwater needs would be less than if the land were farmed, I don t think you= can be too careful. We re making decisions that could affect an economical=ly depressed area for generations to come.\" Other Environmental Conditions:= Twenty-two conditions were imposed by the Arizona Power Plant and Transmis=sion Line Siting Committee. They include: ? Establishment of a monitoring p=roject and mitigation fund for ground subsidence and earth fissure monitori=ng. Subsidence is a potential side effect of groundwater pumping. Cracks, f=issures or dips can form in the surface of the earth because the water deep= underground that provided physical support is no longer there. ? Contribut=ions to the Bowie Fire District to enable it to acquire an additional emerg=ency services vehicle as well as funding of emergency response and hazardou=s materials training for firefighters. ? Making arrangements with local law= enforcement and the Cochise County Sheriff because the project will involv=e an increase in traffic and may result in the need for emergency responses= by local law enforcement. This was an amendment sponsored by Commissioner =Jim Irvin. ? Prior to construction of the facility, SouthWestern must provi=de the Commission with a technical study showing that sufficient transmissi=on capacity exists to accommodate the output of the plant and the effect of= its output on reliable operation of the electric grid. ? Conditions requir=ing compliance with air and water quality standards imposed by the Arizona =Department of Environmental Quality and the Arizona Department of Water Res=ources. Additionally, the applicant will have to participate in and comply =with all standards for safe, reliable power delivery. \"I was pleased to sup=port this project, in part because it includes solar technology as a key co=mponent of the whole project. The level of support from the local community= was also impressive. Les Thompson, Chairman of the Cochise County Board of= Supervisors indicated that Bowie has one of the highest tax rates of any A=rizona community,\" Chairman Bill Mundell explained. \"The residents and busi=ness people were very excited about the tax and economic development benefi=ts of having the power plant in their community. Additionally, the project =will bring several hundred construction jobs to Bowie and Willcox and, ulti=mately, the 30 or 40 people needed to run the plant.\" Commissioner Irvin vo=ted in favor of the project, saying: \"I do believe the need for this projec=t was established in the record. Further, I believe the project is in the p=ublic interest and meets the balancing test.\" He was referring to the sitin=g statute that requires the Commission \"to balance, in the broad public int=erest, the need for an adequate, economical and reliable supply of electric= power with the desire to minimize the effect thereof on the environment an=d ecology of this state.\" (Arizona Revised Statutes ? 40-360.07, subsection= B.)

(NYSE: KMP) and Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN) today announced the termination of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline project. The Sonoran Pipeline was unable to secure sufficient binding commitments to make a successful project given market conditions. Securing firm transportation agreements was a stipulation that executives of both companies initially stated was necessary before development of the project could begin. Neither company has spent significant dollars on the proposed development of the pipeline and it was not expected to begin service until 2004. Both KMP and Calpine will continue to evaluate other opportunities to serve the growing California market. Phase I of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline would have extended from the Blanco Hub and terminated near Needles and Topock, Calif., with the possibility of a second phase extending into northern California. Based in San Jose, Calif., Calpine Corporation is an independent power company that is dedicated to providing customers with clean, efficient, natural gas-fired power generation. It generates and markets power, through plants it develops, owns and operates, in 29 states in the United States, three provinces in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Calpine also is the world s largest producer of renewable geothermal energy, and it owns 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves in Canada and the United States. The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPN. For more information about Calpine, visit its website at www.calpine.com . Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L. P. is the nation s largest pipeline master limited partnership with an enterprise value of approximately $9 billion. KMP owns and operates more than 20,000 miles of pipelines and over 70 terminals. Its pipelines transport more than two million barrels per day of gasoline and other petroleum products and up to 4.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Its terminals handle over 50 million tons of coal and other bulk materials annually and have a liquids storage capacity of more than 53 million barrels for petroleum products and chemicals.

The purchase includes 36,000 acres approximately 30 miles north of Kingman,Arizona, and the rights to develop a salt cavern storage facility. Along withthe land, Aquila purchased the water and mineral rights necessary to develop thefacility.  The facility will have a gas storage capacity of 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf).The first phase of the facility, with a storage capacity of 6 Bcf, is expectedto be in operation by the fourth quarter of 2003, with the full 12 Bcf plannedfor the fourth quarter of 2004. The facility will connect to pipelines operatedby El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline and Transwestern Pipeline Company. Aquilaanticipates beginning an open season for the facility within the next seven toten days. In an open season period a company seeks storages commitments frompotential clients.  \"This facility fits with our strategy to build or acquire assets that enableus to provide clients with the energy they need when they encounter dramaticincreases in demand,\" said Ed Mills, president and chief operating officer ofAquila.  The facility is positioned to serve Arizona power plants, as well as otherfacilities in Nevada and California. There are approximately 60 gas-fired powerplants in Arizona, representing one of the largest single concentrations of suchfacilities in the United States  \"Southwest Gas Corporation is pleased to see the Red Lakes Storage Projectbeing developed,\" said Ed Zub, executive vice president of Southwest GasCorporation. \"Development of this project will benefit the states of Arizona andNevada where Southwest Gas Corporation serves more than 1.1 million customers.\"  Aquila currently owns one of the largest independent storage facilities in thesouthwest, a 21 Bcf facility in Katy, Texas. The company is also currentlycompleting the acquisition of a storage facility near Lodi, California, whichwill provide gas to the frequently energy-short cities in northern California.With the addition of the Red Lake Storage Project, Aquila will be one of thelargest independent storage providers for power plants and local gasdistribution companies in the Southwest.

Everyone agreed it is likely doable under certain conditions not the least of which is FERC approval.  The question I have for you is: how much volume and for how long a period?For example, on any given day, assuming there is no Copper Eagle storage available, it will likely be easier to borrow (ride) gas off the system than to park gas on it.  I think this was your greater concern.  In your ideal world, how much volume would you like to be able to pull off Sun Devil say if your MDQ was 100,000?  Would you want an additional 25,000/day, more or less? and for how long?  Also, how much would you want to Park on the system and for how long?  For purposes of evaluation, assume the cost would be significantly less than a storage option.If you give me some parameters, we will build a service offering that meets your needs as close as possible.

As you may be aware, the Sun Devil project parallels the Transwestern (TW) system to Flagstaff, AZ and will then turn south and parallel a El Paso lateral into Phoenix.  KM has made a proposal to provide services to TW under a \"lease transaction\" for that portion of the pipeline from San Juan, NM to Flagstaff.  The KM proposal offers two obvious advantages: i)  It would allow TW to lower its capital cost to construct the total system, and ii) It would lower the fuel allocated to Sun Devil by TW. There also may be ways to further reduce the tariff proposed to Sun Devil by KM, if TW can provide some of the operations and administration services for KM.We have been negotiating with Shippers for a fee that would yield a minimum rate of return based upon our proposal to build and own the entire system.  However, the KM proposal could allow us an opportunity to save on fuel, operating, administrative and capital costs, thus possibly achieving better project returns, if TW is able to capture revenues from these savings. We would like to explore assessing the Sun Devil Shippers an allocated fuel rate and other fees commensurate with TW s current rate structure.  Will FERC regulations permit us to do these things?  Should the Sun Devil Pipeline be part of TW or should it be under some other corporate structure to capture revenues?

I have also included someadditional questions which I thought of later.  Although I think I havecovered most of the issues, I am certain there will be more as wecontinue our discussions.  As I currently understand, we are going totry and continue our conversation on Wednesday.  Hopefully you will havetime to complete your hydraulic study and answer these questions/issuesby that time.  If you have questions concerning the following, pleasefeel free to contact me at (972) 361-1332 and I will try to helpclarify.Maximum Hourly Quantity - Panda will require the minimum capability toburn the Maximum Daily Quantity in a 16 hour period with the potentialflexibility to burn the plants complete hourly capability over a shortertime frame.  Your voice message to Jim on Thursday, regarding a scaledburn window based on notification timing, should address this issue. Although there may be instances where the actual burn will be over 24hours, the assumption should be that under even the shortestnotification timing, 16 hours would be needed.  Something to considerwould be how to incorporate this schedule into the contract. Consideration would also need to be given in how this, and in generalthe operations and requirements of a power plant, would potentiallydeviate from the standard GISB nomination cycles and corresponding gasflows and how to incorporate that into the contract.Contract Rate - Although approximately $0.45/MMBtu has already beenmentioned, it should suffice to say that the lowest possible cost of ourgas supply, transportation and storage services is the goal.  There are,however, a couple of points that could use some clarification.  First,would the rates in the proposal be maximum rates as defined by a tarifffiling or would these be negotiated?  The current assumption is thatthey are negotiated because of the increase for years 6 through 10 andthe escalator for the remaining 20 years.  The preference would be fornegotiated rates in order to eliminate any rate risk the project wouldhold if they were tariff based.  If they are negotiated, a betterunderstanding of how the rate is broken into its various componentswould be helpful.  If they are tariff based, a better understanding ofthe anticipated increase and the escalator would be needed.Fuel Rate - A better understanding of the reasoning and numbers behindthis rate would be beneficial.  Also, how does Transwestern track andadjust for actual fuel percentages?Delivery Term - A shorter term would be required, somewhere in the 10to 20 year range.Services - Although 500 psi may not be quite enough pressure at thefacility, the hydraulic study should give a better indication of theactual pressures at the plant and should be discussed further after thestudy is complete.  It should be noted that Transwestern s interconnectwith the facility could still be some distance from the plant,therefore, increasing the pressure requirement at the interconnectionpoint to be greater than the plant s requirements.Other Questions - What is the planned capacity of the lateral fromCopper Eagle to the TW/EPNG interconnect?  Would alternative receipt anddelivery combinations be charged based on the tariff commodity and fuelfor the particular path?  Since there is already alternate receipt anddelivery point capabilities, is the 50,000 MMBtu/day backhaul aguarantee?  Although storage is planned at Copper Eagle, how canTranswestern help manage daily imbalances and short notice start up andshut downs in order to minimize penalty exposure?Thanks for your help in trying to address these issues.  I look forwardto talking with you on Wednesday if not sooner.Steve","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinProjectsSun Devil"

Can we set a time for Wednesday afternoon 12/5 to talk?  thanksMax Hourly Quantity:  we are reviewing capability to deliver the MHQ in a 16 hr block.  Doesn t appear to be any problem but we are working thru the hydraulic studies to verify and quantify.  What will be the plant s complete hourly capability?  If you re  receiving gas from both TW and EPNG, and for some reason EPNG shut off deliveries, we can model the impact of delivering all the plant s requirements for known durations.Contract Rate:  will be a negotiated rate (eliminates rate risk for Gila).  The rate design is currently one-part (no differentiation between reservation and commodity).  The rate does not include ACA / GRI surcharges or fuel.  It covers a minimal return on the project s capital cost plus the ongoing O&M.Fuel Rate: Fuel was set with the shippers in the 1996 rate case; the offer to Panda is consistent with the current tariff.Delivery Term:  as the term gets shorter, the rate by necessity, goes up to cover the return hurdles.Services:  delivery pressure at the Panda / EPNG interconnect should be a minimum 700 #Capacity of the lateral from Copper Eagle to EPNG will be 500,000 Dth/d.Alternative rec/del combinations:  Our thought here was if Panda is willing to commit to taking capacity in the project, then TW would give you all the necessary flexibility to move gas to other destinations at the Contract rate.  For instance, Panda would be paying a one-part rate for delivery to the plant.  If for some reason, plant demand was reduced, then you would have all the flexibility to move gas to alternative markets.  Backhaul:  the 50,000/day would be a guarantee.Daily imbalances, short notice start up/ shut down:  We have to plan for the worst case scenario and assume there is no storage.  With this in mind, TW will have some flexibility just due to the size of the project (36\" pipe and 700 - 900 # pressure) but this will depend on what other shippers are doing.  Again, we are modelling the hydraulics.","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinProjectsSun Devil"

Following is a summary of the call with healthy amount of detail since it may be some time before we have a chance to visit.  Due to confidentialities, Jim could only go so far on some details, so you ll note a number of gaps; however, this should cover many of your questions.  Call upon return after the holiday and we can discuss further.Also attached - after notes - is an article that should capture many of the financing details.  Given other demands, I ve not yet read the article so duplication between the notes and article is inevitable.  A word of caution - PFI details are good but not always accurate so rely principally on the call notes.  I also asked for portions of the Offering Memo. but am doubtful on receiving this.  Distribute further as you see fit.Summary of CallThis was a merchant financing with both projects (Phoenix and El Dorado, Arkansas) cross-collateralized and x-defaulted - so treated as a single financing.  Approx. 2250 MW per site for total of 4500 MW (with 4 separate units per site).Sources of funding - Total of $2.8 Bill. ($2.2 Bill in debt and $600 MM in funded equity).  Apparently all of the $600 MM equity was funded at close June 01  [further confirmation is needed].  Of the $2.2 Bill. in debt, $1.7 Bill. was non-recourse and $500 MM was an equity bridge, with recourse to partners.  However, lenders looked principally to TECO s credit backed by several guaranty of equity bridge and fronting of the $600 MM in funded equity.Partnership - 50/50 in all respects (ie. vote and economics).  However, TECO must have some preferential rights (eg. cash flows etc..) given their substantial commits on the deal.  Term of debt - 2 yrs. construct facility plus 3 yr. mini-perm with bullet at maturity (approx. 8% amortized at maturity).  Five years is the market for merchant deals.  Amortization is 18 yr. mortgage style.  144 A expected form of permanent take-out of term debt.  Leverage - 60% financed by term debt, but approx. 50% debt financed when adding all ancillary facilities and other commits (ie. working capital, letters of credit etc..).  Jim kept details to minimum but further info. is needed here.Key Ratio was debt service coverage.  Base Case assumed an average DSCR of 3.40X and Min. of 2.40X with cash trapped at 1.75X.  Did not get detail on whether DSCR was both historical and forward looking, but suspect there was some kind of forward test.  Project finance banks typically expect 3.25 to 4.25 DSCR on merchant finance deals.Leverage, DSCR and structure in general was done based on what is generally required to gain investment grade rating from agencies when permanent take-out is sought.  Additional rating agency requirements can be found on Moody s and S&P web sites.  TECO also will act as operator.  TECO was clearly crucial to deal and at least Soc. Gen. had done prior deals with them (not sure about Citi).  Panda brought TECO into the deals.  Although Panda was a known quantity, Soc. Gen. had no direct project history with them.Fuel and Power Off take - Lenders looked to extensive an Energy Management Program analysis.  The EMP presumed (by C.O.D.):  50% of fuel and power would be under firm contract, 25% of each would be covered by seasonal swing contracts and remaining 25% would remain merchant.  Intention is a complete match (term and volumes) for fuel and power contracts.  Agency agreements were signed with Noble (1yr. contract) on fuel supply mgt. and Aquilla (2 yr. contract) for managing power sales.  Each buys in name of the projects.  TECO is responsible for overall energy mgt. and coordination between Noble and Aquilla.  Jim said EOD is triggered if fuel and power agreements are not signed in line with E.M. Program by C.O.D.  Lenders got comfortable with lack of fuel and power contracts due to substantial equity commitment (approx. $1.1 Bill.).Consultants were Pace for fuel supply and overall energy management and RW Beck for power market eval.Fuel Transport - Much of medium term contracted at close (mix of firm and interruptible capacity) out to 7 yrs.  Lenders looked to new and released capacity to fill non-contracted needs.		  -----Original Message-----From: 	Young, Steve  Sent:	01 November 2001 22:45To:	Gadd, EricSubject:	RE: Gila BendSensitivity:	ConfidentialWill continue to dig.

Consequently, any lateral for this customer would be designed to deliver 1440 per hour.Shorthand for the daily rate is .06 * 24 = 1.44.     Multiplying any MDQ by 1.44 gets the daily rate, assuming the max hour is at 6%.","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinProjectsSun Devil"

He said that he didn tknow where the BLM guy got his numbers, but that $1MM/mile for ROW would beextremely steep.  He said that he has heard about the rumored price KinderMorgan Sonoran might have to pay, said it was pretty astronomical, but notnear that expensive.  We still haven t spoken directly to eachother (justvoice mail).  He said that he was down meeting with \"Octar?\" last week andwill be meeting with \"Octar\" again Tuesday 9/25 in Gallup.  He acted asthough most anyone I m speaking with at Transwestern should know who \"Octar\"is.  I have another call back into him - is there anything specific youwould like me to ask him?  He said that most folks at Transwestern shouldhave a pretty good idea of what ROW costs should be on Navajo. Ed justcalled.  He said that Octar is the Navajo Director of Minerals and that Ed,Louis Soldano, and Johnny McGee just finished negotiating the renewal of thetwin mainlines and the San Juan Lateral through 2009 with Octar - it was$30MM.  He said that they brought up the possibility of a new line withOctar, and that he thought it would be something similar for the new line.ScottScott J.

After the agencies are selected, a meetingshould be scheduled with those key agencies with the purpose ofobtaining their commitment to participate in the early collaborationwith the FERC on the Sun Devil Pipeline Project.  Your thoughts?---We shoulddefinitely meet with the federal land managing agencies as well as theNative Americans.  Better to meet with them individually at this point toassess their interest and willingness to work in an informal collaborativeprocess and ID major issues with the route.  We should also meet with theCOE, FWS and major state agencies to assess the same information.I also would like your input into the composition of the \"team\" thatrequests those meetings and participates.  I view the make-up of theteam players for this task as very important to get this projectoff-the-ground with the right momentum.  (Caveat: I am thinking that youand I (both) should play a dual lead role in these early meetings withLarry Campbell and/or Scott Patti setting them up for us - yourthoughts?) Then we can speak first hand to the FERC Staff about thecommitment to collaborate.  Don t you believe we need to obtain theircommitment prior to meeting with the FERC to discuss being consideredfor the expedited processing?---Yes, FERC requires knowing if the agencieswill be willing to participate in this process.  As for team makeup,Environmental, Business Development, and Engineering/Design should attendthese meetings to discuss FERC process and SunDevil s envi. approach to theproject, need for the project, and routing/design process that will beundertaken to make the project safe.  You and I don t both have to be ateach meeting, but since there will be multiple meetings, we could staffdependent upon schedules and availability.By the way, as \"food for thought\" I have received a note from Doug Lake(NRG) and he stands ready to do the Third Party contractor work on theEIS (if we can get the FERC to agree to let NRG do it without biddingthe job out).  In fact, since NRG has completed their work on the KernRiver loop project - Doug said that he has a team that could be placedon this project about the time we will need them.  That may work outgood for everyone, since the NRG team is familiar with the expeditedprocess, located in the western United States, and familiar with theagencies and contacts in the area of our project.  --NRG would have to convince not only FERC, but Enron they have theresources to complete the work in your aggressive schedule.  This is fairlycritical as you want a consultant who can \"keep up\" in this process and notput a lot of road blocks up.  On Gulfstream, NRGs monitors (representingFERC) are bringing up issues and trying to make issues with things that theFERC PM doesn t even think is worth doing---so we don t want someone doingthings that is right in their own eyes and not looking out for Enron s bestinterests.John Shafer-----Original Message-----From: Patti, Scott [mailto:SPatti@ensr.com]Sent: Thursday, September 20, 2001 4:49 PMTo: Shafer, John; Hyatt, Kevin; Gadd, EricCc: Schmidt, Jon; Taylor, Gina; Cebryk, DougSubject: RE: Confidentiality of Sun Devil???We have already been in contact primarily with most of the state andFederallevel agencies that exist in both AZ and NM as well as the Navajoagencies.I could get you a complete list of agencies we ve contacted if you dlike,but almost every agency that would or could issue a permit in bothstateshas been contacted.

A summary of our discussions is outlined below=.ConceptExplore the possibility of combining the Sun Devil and Sonoran Pipeline pro=jects into a single venture along the existing Transwestern route from San =Juan to the California Border.  Progress separate projects for service to P=hoenix (Sun Devil) and California (Sonoran).RationaleLower costs, higher marginsGreater capacity, economic scale, expansion optionsReduced stakeholder interventions (Navajos, environmental interests groups,= shippers)Reduced regulatory processBackgroundOn May 2, 2001, Kinder Morgan and Calpine announced plans to jointly develo=p the Sonoran Pipeline, subject to customary approvals and sufficient inter=est by potential shippers.  As proposed, the Sonoran pipeline will be a 1,1=60 mile high pressure interstate natural gas pipeline from the San Juan Bas=in in northern New Mexico to markets in California.  The project, with an e=stimated cost of $1.8 billion, will provide natural gas transportation capa=city to California to serve growing electric generation demand. =20The proposed pipeline will be evaluated and developed in two phases.  The f=irst phase will run from the San Juan Basin to the California border with t=he second phase extending from the California border to the San Francisco B=ay area. =20The first phase of the pipeline is expected to be completed in the summer o=f 2003.  Phase one will consist of a 460 mile, 36 inch diameter pipeline fr=om the interconnection of TransColorado Gas Transmission and Transwestern P=ipeline to various points at the Blanco Hub in San Juan, NM.  In addition, =the pipeline will continue westward with deliveries into the California/Ari=zona border.  A 20 mile, 24 inch diameter lateral would be built to Topock,= AZ.  The initial capacity would start with 750,000 dth/d, with capability =to expand to 1 million dth/day.  The estimated cost of phase one is $624 wi=th a targeted in-service date of summer 2003.  Sponsors said the open seaso=n will seek at a minimum, 20-year term commitments at a fixed transport rat=e of $0.39/dth for firm transportation.  Sonoran proposes to charge shipper=s actual fuel on phase one via a fuel tracker.  Fuel is estimated at 1.3%. = More than 1 billion cubic feet per day of binding agreements and non-bindi=ng expressions of interest were received for the first phase of the project=. =20Phase two will be a 590 mile, 42 inch diameter pipeline from Needles on the= California border to points within California, terminating near Antioch in= Contra Costa County.  Once completed, the pipeline will be able to transpo=rt between 1 million and 1.5 million dth/day.  The in-service date for the =phase two has yet to be determined.  The cost is projected to be $1.1 billi=on.   Another 1.5 Bcf/d of non-binding commitments and expressions of inter=est were received for phase two. =20Sonoran has already received binding bids from Calpine Energy Services for =400,000 dth/d for phase one and another 500,000 dth/d for its phase two. On=ce completed, the new pipeline could connect with Kern River, Mojave, Elk H=ills, Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Gas and various gas-fir=ed power plants. =20SoCalGas s Residual Load Service (RLS) penalty woull not affect the Sonoran= project because the pipeline route parallels PG&E s pipelines and the prim=ary target load is new gas-fired generation not within SoCalGas s market te=rritory.=20The pipeline also will connect to a new underground storage facility near L=odi being developed by Lodi Gas Storage, Inc., a subsidiary of Houston base=d Western Hub Properties LLC. =20The project could have a noteworthy co-owner: the Navajo Nation, the sovere=ign government of 180,000 residents on the largest Indian reservation withi=n the United States.  An agreement in principle to give the Navajos an owne=rship interest in the $1.7 billion pipeline that crosses their reservation =was disclosed in August by an executive of Kinder Morgan at Indian Energy 2=001, a conference of the Council of Energy Resource Tribes that highlighted= the growing role Indian tribes play in powering the West.  As part of the =deal to secure that right of way, the Navajo Nation would invest in the pro=ject and receive a minority interest when the pipeline opens.  The deal wou=ld be structured to limit the tribe s exposure to risks during the construc=tion phase of the project.

This is, and always was our mission to provide a full and complete cost estimate for the project.I really don t need a lesson in how to deal with contractors, and fully realize they will do whatever is asked of them, since they are being paid on a time basis.The task of getting ENSR to do a complete cost estimate of all environmental work related to the execution of the project is a vital and important component of the total project cost estimate. Whether the project proceeds or not is highly dependent on the economics of the project, and therfore, getting ENSR to define the work and estimate the associated costs cannot be considered as a wasted task that has no value. We do need an estimate of the all encompassing budget, and then as a complete analysis is done, decide whether to proceed with any or all parts of the defined scope.I look forward to  putting this misunderstanding behind us and work together in a co-ordinated effort to complete the task at hand (getting as good a cost estimate as we can) and see if this project is economically feasibleThank You. -----Original Message-----From: 	Shafer, John  Sent:	Tuesday, September 18, 2001 10:38 AMTo:	Cebryk, Doug; Campbell, Larry;  spatti@ENSR.com Cc:	Kendrick, William; Hyatt, Kevin;  jschmidt@ENSR.com ; Jensen, Ruth; Martin, Jerry D.Subject:	RE: Additional Cost Estimate - Sun Devil ProjectDoug,No, its not unclear.  You are misinterpreting the instructions I was passing along to ENSR.  As a basic premise of dealing with consultants, one has to understand that they will spend time doing whatever you ask them to do (i.e., prepare a budget for tasks from beginning to an FERC filing or prepare a budget for tasks to take us from beginning to post construction).  Either way, you have to pay for what you ask them to do.  Therefore, you keep the marching orders as simple as possible, taking the process in steps.  In this way you eliminate superfluous tasks that are not essential at the moment.   Sometimes these projects start out like \"gangbusters,\" but for commercial reasons or some other reason, they go away and you could be left paying for a task that basically has no added value.  I have found it best not to go that route.  In this instant case, I had broken down my instructions to ENSR so as to minimize their expenditures and even though from your perspective \"ETS has been responsible for preparing a Level B estimate for Sun Devil since day one\", the consultant need only know and respond to the task at hand - which is the way I have handled it.

May be worth investigating as this is likely where we are headed in the near future and in fact, may be a more  efficient  product now for some projects. Based on the moving of technology toward digitally interfaced mapping, if we have knowledgeable people available, this might be a good investment.For Phase VI aerial photography, we checked this out and found:    The turn around time for aerial digital photography was much, much better than for film photography.    Costs seem to be lower although not of significant magnitude.    Overlay onto drawing system files would be much easier & faster especially if system is laid out in this format - which I understand Enron is headed towards.    Shortcoming was the fine detail or ROW objects - telephone pole shadows, etc. that show up on film but not on current digital technology. For Phase VI, we wound up sticking with film to be sure we got what we needed.  We did not have time to do it twice and there was risk plus it seemed sure we would eventually have to do the film later for the detail. These shortcomings will probably go away in the next generation of digital cameras.  In addition, in a short FERC filing deadline, these details do not appear necessary for FERC, only for later detail engineering design.

I worked up three cases, one looking at a San Juan route, and two others looking at El Paso s Line 2000.  The first Line 2000 case assumed that the line was empty and could be dedicated to this project, which is probably not realistic.  But another way to look at this is it would be very easy for El Paso to incrementally build out capacity on Line 2000 to serve new Phoenix loads.   The second Line 2000 case (third case overall) assumed that there was already 320 mmscfd of capacity used up, and that 450 mmscfd of capacity for Phoenix markets would be layered on top of that.   This is very close to, or at, the maximum capabilities of this line without loop.  I also gave a range of costs based on some variability in the lay costs for pipe and purchase costs of new horsepower.  I ll be in Houston working on a task force in 3 Allen from Tuesday to Friday, 9/4-9/7.  Leave me a message or beep me and we can talk about this some more.

Can you provide answers to these questions?Thanks or your help, GinaPS - the capitol of Arizona is Phoenix.QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWEREDHow much new gas is being produced in the Rocky Mountain and San Juan gas supply basins? [Hyatt, Kevin]   San Juan Basin production peaked in 1999 at 4.3 Bcf/day and is expected to decline by 2.4% year for the next 10 years.  However, over the same 10 year forcast period, 6500 new wells are scheduled to start producing.  In addition, current Rockies production is expected to average 250 MMcf/d in 2001 growing to 570 MMcfd by 2009.   What gas-fired electric generation projects will be served by Sun Devil? [Hyatt, Kevin]    There are a number of power plants currently being developed in the Phoenix area.  We are evaluating which projects make the most economic sense to serve. Kinder Morgan and El Paso are proposing pipeline projects to serve Arizona and California.  Why do we need another pipeline? [Hyatt, Kevin]    The KM Sonoran project proposes to serve the California border and eventually the San Francisco area, not southwest Arizona.  El Paso s proposed expansion is not expected to be enough to meet the growing demands of the Southwest including Phoenix, Southern California, and Baja California.Gas prices are collapsing in the Permian basin.  How competitive are new gas supplies from the Rocky Mountain and San Juan basins? [Hyatt, Kevin]  Gas production in the Rockies and San Juan basin has been on the increase but there has not been enough pipeline capacity to move the gas to market.  This capacity bottleneck has had the effect of depressing prices in the San Juan basin.  Historically, San Juan prices have been a few pennies to as much as fifty-cents below Permian gas prices.  As recently as Jan. 2001, San Juan gas was nearly $2.00 less than Permian. Why are so many power projects being developed in Phoenix?  How necessary is all this new power generation capacity?  What markets will it serve?[Hyatt, Kevin]  The Southwest U.S., inlcuding the Phoenix area, has experienced an increase in population and therefore energy demand.  Over the last several years, power reserve margins (the available power supply in excess of demand) have been shrinking from a high of 22% to less than 8%.  This reserve margin decline, coupled with a drought-induced decrease in available hydro power supplies from the Northwest, have created a need for new electric power plant generation capacity.  Because of the availability of high voltage transmission capacity from the Palo Verde area, it was natural for developers to site plants near these lines to move power into Phoenix and Southern California.The economy is not nearly as strong now as it was last year.  Why do we need more pipelines and power plants? [Hyatt, Kevin]   Existing pipe capacity to the Phoenix and So. California areas is not sufficient to meet EXISTING demands, let alone the demand created by the new power plants under construction.  There are more power plants planned for the Phoenix area, but with the economy slowing down, those projects may be somewhat delayed.","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinProjectsSun Devil"

I am very interested in what you see and the potentials that are there.  Don t forget to take your camera.  Pictures (slides) would be most helpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield portion.  As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates, we will need to develop some preliminary maps.  It is my understanding that no maps of the route will be released with sign-off from the entire group of: Hyatt, Taylor, Veatch and Shafer.After we receive the \"fatal-flaw\" desk-top analysis from ENSR (Sept. 21 - although I hope to get it sooner), I would offer that several events should be scheduled to expedite the project as follows:1. If the open season reflects that we have a project and Eric Gadd approves, a couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the project potential (TNC, State Land Managing agencies, US Forest Service, etc).  These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal-flaw analysis.2. Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season reflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental Strategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out soliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits). 3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with the FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, US Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to introduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources early in the process.4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs strategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with local, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so the right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news media.  This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the project will formally be announced (i.e., news conference in Phoenix or Houston, etc.).  A $580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix area and for the Southwest.I know there is more, but this will help to keep some of the early events coordinated.

These activities include not only the environemntal issue=s but also things like socioeconomics, land use soils, geology etc.  Past c=onsttruction projects has shown that third party involvement with this grea=tly expidites the process (John has eluded to this previously).  Due to the= rough terrain and topography of the land south of Station 2 into Phoenix m=akes this project extremely hard to give an approximate dollar amount  for =the environmental baseline surveys and permits to be completed as the entir=e proposed right of way (140 miles) from station 2 into Phoenix will need t=o be walked and surveyed by several people.  I would rather wait until we c=an identify on a map the corridor route and send out proposals for each of =the surveys to be performed on the pipeline prior to giving a $$$$ figure. =  However, because you need something for a preliminary budget estimate, I =would recommend an amount of $70,000 to 90,000  for the baseline environmen=tal work and this might be a little light, in the event the surveys identif=y something.......please dont hold me too close to this number as it is a W=AG contingent upon a number of variables that are relatively unclear at thi=s time.

I found this article interesting, especially in light of potential future expansions on TW.  Note the section below in bold Red text.  Camp Navajo is nearly due South of Station 2 just across Interstate 40 and as you know, Kachina Village is South of Flagstaff off Interstate 15.  This may or may not pose any direct threats to TW ROW s but, it does give us a flavor of public sentiment with regards to conserving these areas.....   Anyhow, fyi...  (Oh yea, The Grand Canyon Trust & The Nature Conservancy in Flagstaff share the same office building)  New land pegged for preservationBy ANNE MINARDSun Staff Reporter07/29/2001  |Reader CommentsIt s been less than a year since Arizona voters narrowlyrejected Proposition 100, a plan to protect 290,000acres of State Trust Land from development.And in about a month, voters could be asked to beginsigning petitions to get another initiative on theballot that would protect significantly more of thestate s legacy -- 1 million acres, or about 10 percent,including thousands of acres in and around Flagstaff.The difference, conservationists say, is that this landhas been chosen with the goal of protecting biologicallyand aesthetically important areas. The environmentalcommunity rallied against Prop. 100 because they saidthe lands chosen for protection were insufficient andhad little value for conservation.For example, the Proposition 100 campaign identified 10acres of Rio De Flag in east Flagstaff -- near awastewater treatment plant outflow -- as one of thestate s \"crown jewels\" needing to be preserved.Two other parcels in the Flagstaff area included 15acres on Wildcat Hill with an unimpressive view of anindustrial park and 269 acres of steep slopes litteredwith shot-up refrigerators and television sets calledTurkey Hills.Rogers Lake, an important wetland and major ecosystemsouth of Flagstaff, was also slated for preservationunder Prop 100. But that plan only included its soggylakebed, while 2,000 acres of highly developableshoreline owned by the State Trust Land Department wasstill up for grabs.THE NEW PLANThe new initiative would include all areas around RogersLake, excluding those that are private or held by theU.S. Forest Service. One proposed parcel does still fallin the Turkey Hills area, and three others lie betweenFlagstaff proper and Walnut Canyon (not included isSection 20, which is likely to be sold and developed,but at densities that are still in dispute between thecounty and the city).Other areas would include parcels around ObservatoryMesa (a contiguous chunk of land south and west of theNaval Observatory) and a checkerboard pattern ofsections -- interspersed with Forest Service land --south of Camp Navajo and west of Kachina Village andGriffiths Spring.Like Prop. 100, an initiative would be only a firststep. If it were to appear on the ballot and then pass,it would take an act of Congress, and a constitutionalamendment, to change the availability of State TrustLands.State Trust Lands include about 135 million acres acrossthe country -- 9.3 million in Arizona -- originallyallocated by the federal government when each state wasformed to help fund public schools. (See related storyon Page A11.)Brad Ack, program director for the Flagstaff-based GrandCanyon Trust who is helping spearhead the initiative,said the state s schools shouldn t be bought and paidfor with proceeds from unmanaged sprawl. Areas set asideunder the initiative could still be leased for grazing,agriculture or other current uses -- but they wouldnever be sold for commercial development.Making an informed decision to set aside designatedState Trust Lands will free others from the battles thatnow accompany proposals to develop them, he said.The initiative is a collaborative effort between theGrand Canyon Trust and other conservation groups, alongwith some business and development affiliates.And supporters are touting a recent poll conducted bythe Grand Canyon Trust, the Sonoran Institute in Tucsonand the Nature Conservancy that showed 88 percent ofArizona voters agreed that some of Arizona s State TrustLand should be conserved.TALKING COMPENSATIONBut members of the State Department of Lands chargedwith managing the tracts -- and a lobbyist forsuperintendents and principals in the state s schoolsystem -- say the initiative backers are missing themark in the state land debate.\"We have a fundamental difference of opinion with ourfriends in the environmental community,\" said MikeSmith, a contract lobbyist for the Arizona SchoolAdministrator Association. \"Preserve, set aside ... wethink those are great ideas. The question iscompensation. Those State Trust Lands are in trust forthe schools. It s acutely important for schools tomaximize the returns on state lands.\"Smith acknowledged that the awareness of their legacy isnew for the state s schools. Until recently, the schoolsdidn t see a whole lot of benefit from the state trusts.\"We haven t seen any of it. The state Legislature hastaken the annual earnings, and has used it to reducestate aid coming out of the general fund.\"That all changed with the passage of Proposition 301,passed last year, he said.\"In addition to increasing sales tax for the schools ...they also said,  By the way, all new earnings from thestate trust fund go into the school site fund.  All of asudden, it s real different for us. Before it supplantedour funding, now it will supplement it. It s real moneyto us.\"The Legislature will still keep the money it has beenearning from State Trust Lands -- about $80 million ayear. But anything above that mark will now go to theschools, and both Smith and Nick Simonetta, manager ofcommunications and legislative affairs for the ArizonaDepartment of Lands, are optimistic that figure willclimb rapidly in the coming years. Simonetta estimatesthe schools could see $650 million in addition tolegislative appropriations over the next decade.LOOKING BACKBut the past irregularities are a stronghold forconservationists who are promoting the land reforminitiative.In background literature for its State Trust Land ReformInitiative, the Grand Canyon Trust says that the StateTrust Lands haven t been used as they were intendedanyway, and very little money has gone to Arizonaschools.\"State Trust Lands currently provide less than 2 percentof the annual funding for public education,\" thedocument reads. \"... there is little, if any, directbenefit from State Trust Lands to our public schools.\"Simonetta said he strongly disagrees with thatassessment.\"I think those statements are severely misleading andnot reflective of what is currently the case. You canthrow around percentages any way you want. If you lookat what the trust has been contributing to the schoolconstruction budget, it s more like 30 or 40 percent.\"Regardless, Simonetta and Smith agree that the future ofState Trust Land will rest on its ability to generatefunds -- and won t be given away for free.\"It comes down to this: We are in intense discussionwith the conservation community,\" Smith said. \"Ourconversations are all around the question ofcompensation. We are not going to support any initiativethat contemplates setting aside State Trust Land withoutcompensation. You can take that non-support as far asyou like. If they attempt to go to Congress, we aregoing with them.\"Anne Minard can be reached at aminard@azdailysun.com or556-2253.","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinProjectsSun Devil"

She was very cordial and appreciative concerning Transwestern s proactive efforts to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies  which may have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project.  Although the proposed route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established, she did  offer some general, yet valuable information concerning the geographic area which exists south of Flagstaff into roughly northern Phoenix.  The area south of Flagstaff into Phoenix crosses of three major ecological regions identified by the TNC with major biological diversity of plants and animals.  The TNC has completed published studies on two of the regions.  The TNC has requested that should this project be apporved, these publications be used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed prior to construction and approval by FERC.  To the south and east of Flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the Verde River which is of ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species which live in and around the area of the River.   This river could be impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction across Arizona.  I have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies, in addition to the TNC, and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the pipeline corridor route.  Part of this concern is due to the extensive and unique biological diversity of Arizona.  I think we will have a better handle on how we address the environmental concerns and opportunities when this piece of the puzzle is completed and also how much more specific and helpful the agencies assistance will be when identified areas are known.","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinProjectsSun Devil"

Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, \"We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent s Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies.\" Regent President John Ehrman said, \"The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease.\" The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent s core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinProjectsSun Devil"

The lateral is approximately 35 miles long and is a 20-inch diameter pipeline.The Gomez lateral is currently not in service and is filled with sweet gas.  Per Field Operations personnel, the last time the line was used was October 31, 2000.  Pioneer Gas Pipeline is an intratstate gathering and transmission company.  Pioneer has expressed a written interest in acquiring the lateral from TW for $2 million.  Current book value on the line is ______________ .TW could file with FERC for abandonment of the pipe (and sale) under the existing blanket authority if:	1) no IT gas has flowed for the 12 months prior to effective date of the sale or;	2) no FT shipper has a firm receipt or delivery point on the lateral for the 12 months prior...If an FT shipper does have a valid contract on the lateral, then we would need to get the shipper to amend his contract to effectuate the sale.Items to Verify: 1) Identify any entity currently having firm receipt or delivery rights on the Gomez lateral 2) Determine volume of gas in pipe and associated value for sale (field ops is checking)Opportunities for TW:By Pioneer puchasing and integrating the lateral into their system, they can effectuate incremental supply deliveries into TW.  This would reduce the amount of gas necessary for TW to transport south of WT-2 (via displacement) and make more supply available for deliveries going west.A lunch has been scheduled with Phil Allard from Pioneer on Wednesday 2/20 if you would like to attend.","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinProjects"

This will at the very least be a starting point for our discussions. The following are the details as I understand it:The Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect is one of three Interconnect points with Citizens that gas is nominated to on a daily basis.  One daily nom is made by Citizens that covers all three interconnect points.  The other two interconnect points are Citizens F89A interconnect (In Flagstaff) and the Citizens Kingman TBS interconect.  (two points in Flagstaff and one in Kingman)  Again, one nomination is made covering Citizens at all three points.  The total nomination is not to exceed 25 mmcfd.  This 25 mmcfd can be split between all three points or taken as a total at any one point.   (I hope that made sense)  So, with that said, as I understand it, we must maintain the ability to provide 25 mmcfd at the Citizens Flagstaff point of delivery.  We have approximately 7 miles of 6\" lateral from Transwesterns 30\" mainline feeding this interconnect.  Once at the metering station we have a 4\" auto adjust turbine meter which is limited on flowing capacity based of inlet pressure to some degree.  (See chart below)  Please see drawing (Flagstaff 6\" Lateral  ICCU-AB-A1-01) for details of meter station yard and piping.  Once the gas flows out of the 4\" turbine meter we discharge into a line heater that Transwestern owns.  Immediatily on the discharge side of the line heater, Citizens piping begins.  Citizens has 2 ea., 2\" regulator runs that control pressure into their City mainline.  (Again please refer to the drawing number listed above for detail)  I know that pressure profiles in Section 3 will change after Red Rock so I would not dare to guess what the supply pressure to the 6\" Lateral would be but, System Ops should be able to provide this info on a best/worst case senario both pre and post Red Rock.

The actual project is to install an additional tap and measuring facilities at the end of the lateral for peak deliveries of 12-15 MMcfd to ENA for power generating.  The problem is that the lateral capacity is about 25-27 MMcfd based upon turbine meter capacity for the Citizens Flagstaff point, but Citizens has about 25 MMcfd scheduled at their three points on the west end.  Their contract allows for them to take full obligations at either point (Kevin is checking on this); however, I don t believe that their flow regulation at the Flagstaff point (two-2\" regulators) can do more than 15 MMcfd (my intuitive guess, needs to be checked or verified).

Under the interconnect agreement, Citizens has to be able to take a min. and max pressure of 600-1000 psig from TW.  The good news is as follows:	Citizens has amended their transport volume for the Flagstaff point (poi# 500134) to 2,000/MMBtu/d effective 6/01 - 10/01 and only 5,000/d from 11/01 - 2/07.  This is a significant reduction over what they took thru the point for the winter months Oct  00 thru Mar 01.  What this means to TW/ENA is there appears to be capacity available today thru the Flagstaff lateral that would serve the generation plant being proposed by EES.  So any volume TW delivers for EES, up to the capacity max on the lateral (25,000/d), should not impare deliveries to Citizens.  I have a question for Fac. Planning: does the Flagstaff N.E. POI# 500046 lie on the same lateral?  If it does, then Citizens has 1,990 MMBtu/d for 6/01 - 10/01 and 2,950 MMBtu/d for 11/01 - 2/07 also contracted and we have to keep this in mind as the look at the volume EES may need.

The actual project is to install an additional tap and measuring facilities at the end of the lateral for peak deliveries of 12-15 MMcfd to ENA for power generating.  The problem is that the lateral capacity is about 25-27 MMcfd based upon turbine meter capacity for the Citizens Flagstaff point, but Citizens has about 25 MMcfd scheduled at their three points on the west end.  Their contract allows for them to take full obligations at either point (Kevin is checking on this); however, I don t believe that their flow regulation at the Flagstaff point (two-2\" regulators) can do more than 15 MMcfd (my intuitive guess, needs to be checked or verified).  Pressure - TW may be between 725-775 psig at peak TW mainline flows to Ca., Citizens pressure is reported to be around 365 psig downstream of control valves.   The greatest daily volume (MN 9213) since Jan 2000 was 11942 Mcf on Jan. 18, 2001 (as can be seen in the attached Excel worksheet extracted from MIPS meas. data).  The flow graph on Jan 18, 2001 also obtained from MIPS is shown below: << File: MN9213_daily_vol.xls >>    Planning Question: if Citizens meter capacity is say 15 MMcfd at some pressure, can we subscribe the remaining lateral capacity to ENA and still maintain pressure and volume obligations to either Citizens or ENA?  What would new pressure conditions look like flowing 30 MMcfd through the lateral? -----Original Message-----From: 	Eric Faucheaux  Sent:	Thursday, May 31, 2001 7:43 PMTo:	Eric FaucheauxSubject:	Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect---------------------- Forwarded by Eric Faucheaux/ET&S/Enron on 05/31/2001 02:40 PM ---------------------------    	  From:  David Roensch                           05/16/2001 01:25 PM			To:	Eric Faucheaux/ET&S/Enron, Rich Jolly/ET&S/Enron@Enron <mailto:Jolly/ET&S/Enron@Enron>cc:	 Subject:	Citizens Flagstaff InterconnectEric, I m going to try an provide the info requested this morning.  This will at the very least be a starting point for our discussions. The following are the details as I understand it:The Citizens Flagstaff Interconnect is one of three Interconnect points with Citizens that gas is nominated to on a daily basis.  One daily nom is made by Citizens that covers all three interconnect points.  The other two interconnect points are Citizens F89A interconnect (In Flagstaff) and the Citizens Kingman TBS interconnect.  (two points in Flagstaff and one in Kingman)  Again, one nomination is made covering Citizens at all three points.  The total nomination is not to exceed 25 mmcfd.  This 25 mmcfd can be split between all three points or taken as a total at any one point.   (I hope that made sense)  So, with that said, as I understand it, we must maintain the ability to provide 25 mmcfd at the Citizens Flagstaff point of delivery.  We have approximately 7 miles of 6\" lateral from Transwesterns 30\" mainline feeding this interconnect.  Once at the metering station we have a 4\" auto adjust turbine meter which is limited on flowing capacity based of inlet pressure to some degree.  (See chart below)  Please see drawing (Flagstaff 6\" Lateral  ICCU-AB-A1-01) for details of meter station yard and piping.  Once the gas flows out of the 4\" turbine meter we discharge into a line heater that Transwestern owns.  Immediately on the discharge side of the line heater, Citizens piping begins.  Citizens has 2 ea., 2\" regulator runs that control pressure into their City mainline.  (Again please refer to the drawing number listed above for detail)  I know that pressure profiles in Section 3 will change after Red Rock so I would not dare to guess what the supply pressure to the 6\" Lateral would be but, System Ops should be able to provide this info on a best/worst case senario both pre and post Red Rock.  (Assumptions would have to allow for a unit down at Station 2 & 3, I would assume)  Flow Capacity Info for a 4\" Auto Adjust Turbine Meter:Pressure               Max Flow Rate600#                                  19,920 mscfd     700#                                  23,540 mscfd800#                                  27,310 mscfd900#                                  31,200 mscfdThe flowing capacity between the various pressures can be interpolatedI hope this answered some of your questions.

Here are the issues with this nitrogen rejection technology.Adaptation of PSA technology, controls pore diameter (pd) at 3.7 A, and excludes methane which has a pd of 3.8 A and captures the nitrogen with a pd of 3.6 A.Nice feature, there is only a 15 psi pressure drop between the feed gas and the product gas for this technology.IssuesAt low inlet pressures or low nitrogen concentrations the methane recovery can be as low as 80% unless a recycle system is utilized.  Then the recovery rate improves to greater than 90%.As the inlet pressure increases, the recovery improves to 95+% but the recycle is approx. 15%.PSA technology has operated at a 600 psig maximum pressure economically, since it uses many 300 ANSI flanges and valves.  Higher pressures are achievable, but the gas recoveries costs are required to be offset the higher cost of 600 ANSI valves and flanges.The tail gas stream needs to have an economic home.  This stream operates in the 7 psia to 15 psia range and has a 300 Btu/scf.If the feed gas has a high concentration of C3s and C4+ a pre treatment BPSA is required to extract the heavies for the nitrogen removal PSA.Gas impurities like CO2 or H2S each require evaluation based on feed gas analysis. Engelhard claims for 300 to 800 psia operating range, it can deliver 4% nitrogen in the residue gas and will achieve a 97.5% methane recovery for 5% nitrogen stream and the recovery falls to 90% methane for a feed stream of 25% nitrogen.

Their process is new technology and have only a few units in production that is available for field inspection.  One unit is located in SW Colorado and reduces dehydrated gas from 18% to 3% N2.  The process is called the Molecular Gate System and uses a patented mole sieve absorbent process.  The process removes both nitrogen and CO2 with a pressure drop across the unit of approximately 15 psi.  Some methane is lost in the regeneration process and an enriched recycle stream high in C4+ will need to be recycled requiring a small compressor unit.  Estimated costs excluding a recycle compressor are about $1.7MM for a 5MMcfd unit and $2.5MM for a 15 MMcfd unit.  Installation is not included in estimated costs but may vary between $100K to $200K for locations.I am investigating this process further because I feel that the benefits of nitrogen removal in the Bushton Universe might prove to be economical with satelite installations versus a common point cryogenic plant considering that NNG is currently transporting 45 - 50 MMcf of N2 per day.  The removal of N2 would equate to lower O&M expenses on compression and higher heating values on the NNG system.  Both would help Enron realize higher revenue potential.

Initial power supplies from the re-started and re-built units will begin in August, said Aaron Thomas, AES s San Francisco-based manager for California operations. Separately, Calpine Corp. on Tuesday announced that initial construction of 135 MW of peaking generation capacity will begin this week next to the company s existing Gilroy power plant in Gilroy, CA, an agriculture town not far from Calpine s San Jose headquarters. Upon completion of a two-phase build-out, the Gilroy Energy Center will be a 270 MW, natural gas-fired, simple cycle peaking generation facility. Commercial operation of phase one is scheduled for September 2001. An additional three 45 MW gas turbine generators will be installed in phase two, with full build out estimated for May 2002. No one thinks current efforts, not matter how accelerated, will avoid rolling blackouts, however. \"There obviously is concern among some munis that they have adequate supplies, but are still asked to participate in rolling blackouts anyway (the 1 million-customers Sacramento Municipal Utility District is in that category),\" said Jordan. \"To the extent there is the possibility of bringing on emergency generators, that is being done. Everyone has done pretty much what they can do.\" Jordan noted that the public sector generators, like their private sector counterparts, need air quality restrictions waived temporarily so units that carry restricted hours of operations can be turned loose during summer peak demands to help avoid blackouts.","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinProjects"

As we do not know exactly what we will plan to do at this time, this is just a best guess but gives a reference of what might be expected.As can be seen, replacement of the mainline valves and replacement costs for the Class 3 pipe are the highest drivers.  We are still uncertain whether the valves on the launchers and receivers are rated for 1008 psig and have not been included at this time for replacement.  I will check on this while in the Gallup area.  All of the valves requiring replacment will have some salvage and reuse value for potential use on other pipeline systems in ETS that will need to be converted to being smart piggable in the future I am quite sure.  If there are other alternatives later defined in lieu of pipe replacment for class 3 pipe, this would also drive this cost down.Anyway, it s a start. << File: TW MAOP Upgrade-Cost Estimate.xls >> Max","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinProjects"

Steve said that the agreement should express the intent to evaluate for a partnership interest, possibly operating the Southern Trail facilities and/or purchasing a portion of Southern Trails.

However, since we ve recently worked with our other power plants to get them up and running, the data is still pretty fresh.  If I m speaking out of school here, my operations and/or engineering buddies will be quick to correct me.At the proposed take-off point to your Big Sandy Project, flowing gas on TW is in the range of 850 - 900 psig.  We provide a minimum of 800 psig to the LDC s connected with us at the California border. Therefore, for purposes of your take-away lateral pipeline design, I d say that 800 psig is probably a pretty good target number.  However, I must stress that the 800 psig is a flowing gas number, and would surely be impacted by how the gas is taken.  That is to say that TW may provide the 800 psig pressure if and only if all of the downstream operators folllow their schedules for delivery.  For example, none of our new power plants can simply ramp-up without giving TW ample notice of start-up and scheduling an appropriate quantity of gas.We can get into more detail regarding the requirements for operating the Big Sandy delivery point and scheduling gas on TW to meet the plant s requirements at a later date.  Suffice it to say that a plant the size of the Big Sandy project presents some unique operating challenges to TW.   TW has but 1.1 Bcf/d of gas flowing westward.  Directly-connected gas turbines can quickly deplete TW s linepack.  However, that being said, we will do our best to work with Big Sandy as well as our other power plant partners to try and meet the loading requirements of the facilities.My gas control coordinator is about go on his honeymoon during the middle 2 weeks of May.  We should think about having our meeting after he returns (after May 25?) so that we have not only our engineers, but the proper operations and gas control personnel present also.

Previous attempts by Operations to turndown the P-2 unit using the surge valve for recycle allowed approximately 100 MMcfd before reaching high discharge temperature, but high suction pressures were available from P-1 compression in a north flow scenario.Volume analysis over the past year to date indicated volumes through P-3 of 100 MMcfd; thus, with 150 MMcfd proposed to be scheduled through the NNG Gray I/C, a balance of 50 MMcfd would have to flow south to P-2.  Throughput analyses were based upon needing to have P-2 turned down to a volume of at least 50 MMcfd.  Additionally, P-2 throughput analyses considered available pressures that would be available on NNG s KB line.  KB line pressures can be expected to get as low as 600 psig; therefore, pressure drop from the NNG Gray I/C to P-2 suction would yield P-2 suction pressures between 570 to 550 psig for low volumes of 50 to 80 MMcfd, respectively.  Required discharge pressures at these volumes would be 850 to 885 psig.  The P-2 single wheel stage will not handle a differential pressure of 270 to 335 psig.  P-2 is designed to handle differential pressures of 180-190 psig.Re-wheeling the P-2 unit (3 stage) is not a viable option due to the operational flexibility that would be required to maintain Panhandle Lateral certificate capacity of 250 MMcfd.Due to the pressure spreads that would be required to meet low flow demands, consideration was given to add additional reciprocating horsepower at P-2 to handle low flow demands without P-1 online.  50 MMcfd throughput at P-2 would require 1200 HP and 80 MMcfd would require 2100 HP at pressure differentials of 270 and 335 psig, respectively.  The cost of adding horsepower and piping modifications at P-2 is not a feasible option for accommodating NNG-Gray volumes.  Also new air emissions permitting and regulatory filing would be a greater concern compared to installing a new line as follows.The most viable option would be to install a new tap on the KB Line closer to P-3, install approximately 1.75 miles of 16\" from tap to P-3, and modify station yard piping for various control configurations.  The existing NNG-Gray measurement and control facilities would be relocated to the end of the new lateral and located inside P-3 plant boundaries.   This new tap, lateral and meter relocation option would provide the following benefits: 1.	Receipt of 150-175 MMcfd2.	Greater operational flexibility utilizing NNG/TW synergies3.	Long-term operational reliability4.	Greater horsepower utilization at single location5.	Guarantee of receipt capacity from NNG regardless of low KB line pressure6.	Possibility of free-flow capacity from NNG not requiring P-3 compression during winter times with NNG Pampa on-line, which could be possible at high or 	low flow conditions depending on TW pressures at Roswell (Sta. 9)7.	Fractional increase of O&M expenses at P-3 compared to higher O&M expenses of adding horsepower at P-2A level \"A\" cost estimate for installing a new tap on the KB Line closer to P-3, installing approximately 1.75 miles of 16\" from tap to P-3, and modifying station yard piping for various control configurations would be $1,300,000.  Due to the complexity of configurations that P-3 is already capable of and introducing a new stream with various flow paths that may become possible, a field visit to the proposed construction sites would be recommended prior to submitting a Level \"B\" or \"C\" release.  See attached sketch for general route information proposed.Moreover, the relocation of the NNG interconnect and installing the new lateral should create the opportunity for greater receipt volumes from NNG considering larger pipe and expanded I/C facilities because P-3 has plenty of available horsepower to utilize.  Actual conditions were provided by Operations from dates in the past where P-3 was actually compressing 370 MMcfd w/ units 3,4 & 5, Ps-599psig/Pd-874psig; also 265 MMcfd w/ units 2 & 5, Ps-540 psig/Pd-844 psig.  Depending on NNG conditions greater volumes than 150 MMcfd may be realized into TW having 250 MMcfd flowing south and additional volumes available to flow to Red Deer, Lefors and Cactus Laterals if needed.I will be attending an offsite ETS Planning & Power Services department conference on Wednesday and Thursday.  Perhaps on Friday or early next week we should convene for further discussions via conference call with all interested parties call for direction of this proposal.  I will be checking my voice mail periodically for any comments and will call back during breaks if possible.  You may also send a text message to my pager at 8777270018@skytel.com.

Because the meeting was the first of a series aimed at identifying and agreeing on structuring, no concrete decisions were reached.  However, a number of issues were identified and discussed:1.   Relative ownership in the Project?  Both Enron and Kinder agree on a 50/50 split.2.	Who operates?  Enron and Kinder both expressed a strong desire to have \"business operation\" rights, i.e. gas control, contract admin., marketing, etc.  Rod suggested that the impasse might be broken vis-?-vis the creation of a separate operating entity, which would be free to contract services from the parent companies.  Alternatively, either company might bid for the right to provide these services to the new pipeline.  Further negotiations on this issue are needed.3.	What type of corporate entity?  Both Enron and Kinder thought the deal looked like an ideal candidate to drop into a LLC.  Moreover, Kinder noted an interest in possibility creating a MLP for their side of the investment.  No decisions were reached, but it was agreed that both companies probably were probably aligned with respect to cash flow and tax considerations.4.	Rate issues.  Rod suggested that the parties consider \"leasing\" capacity to Pemex instead of filing a more conventional application for a FERC rate for firm carriage.  Rod believes there may financial and/or process advantages to this approach, and will attempt to classify and quantify same.5.	Form of Commitment.  Both Enron and Kinder agreed that Pemex must be willing to execute a firm binding contract for a quantity of capacity (either under lease or under firm, one-part rates) sufficient to earn a reasonable rate of return.  Independently, each party had earlier discussed with Pemex a minimum term of at least 15 years.  Enron and Kinder talked about the use of 15% as an appropriate hurdle rate for investment.6.	Project Financing.  Rod suggested that once the project has taken root, the parties should consider involving Mexican banks for financing.  With contracts and non-recourse financing from Mexico, presumably, there would be no currency risk to manage.7.	Engineering/Design work.  Enron has agreed to do the preliminary design, mapping and [order of magnitude] cost estimation work.  Enron has committed to meeting with its NGPL counterparts next week (Tues., or Wed.) to go over design assumptions and final location of interconnection facilities.8.	Next Commercial meeting.  NGPL and Enron will talk by telephone on Monday to see if internal meetings have yielded progress on the issues of facility operations and possible forms of business structuring.9.	Joint Presentation to Pemex.  Assuming Enron and NGPL are able to reach tentative agreement on the construct of a joint partnership for the project, both parties will make a presentation of their findings and offer a joint proposal to Pemex.  The Pemex meeting is tentatively scheduled for May 23 in Mexico City.Rod, will you and Danny and/or Steve Harris brief Stan on this project during Monday s staff meeting?  Morgan, will you confirm that you and Eric are prepared to meet with NGPL by Wed. next week to discuss design assumptions and location of interconnects?Thanks.Jeff","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinProjects"

With the addition of the Calpine South Point project, we have delivery point capacity off the Topock Lateral approaching 1 Bcf/d.  However, we are currently limited to 400,000 Dth/d of capacity in the Topock Lateral itself.  Steve has asked us to look at what facilities/costs would be involved in increasing the deliverability of the Topock Lateral (no mainline capacity additions are implied, beyond the addition of Red Rock).What would be the best/cheapest capacity additions we could make with respect to the Topock Lateral?  Drawing on my vast engineering expertise (ha,ha), it seems to me that with the directly connected power plant located approx. midway along the lateral line, wouldn t a compressor station immediately upstream of Calpine offer us the dual benefit of not only increased lateral capacity, but additional operating flexibility to meet the load curves for the plant?  Anyway, you guys are the experts, but we re asking that you look at a few cases and sketch out the associated costs of increasing the Topock Lateral capacity.  By way of suggested guidelines, I d say that we d like to see cases that provide for not less than 50 MMcf/d of incremental capacity, and not more than a doubling of the current line capacity (400 MMcf/d).  Again, its a cost/benefit sort of analysis, so we re really looking to key in on the cheapest, most economical capacity addition.James, would you remain plugged in here, and given the information that Eric and/or Ben may provide, be prepared to give us some rate implications for this capacity addition?Unless this creates too big a burden on your existing schedule of projects, can we set a deadline of March 30th with some Topock Lateral expansion cases along with costs/rates implications?

I guess that means that in the cert=. app., we just tell the commission that we will be 100% at risk and that g=iven the huge interest in the open season, we have no doubts about our abil=ity to sell the full 150.  We should also tell the Commission we expect to =sell the capacity using negotiated rate contracts or recourse rate contract=s or a combination of both. =20Q 2.  Can we give prospective customers a \"cafeteria style\" menu of options= (to steal Jeff s term), like the following:=091.  5 yr. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.60 plus fuel and surcharges (o=r whatever number we decide on)=092.  10 y. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.45 plus fuel and surcharges=093.  15 yr. neg rate deal at a locked in $.35 blah blah=094 .  15 yr cost based recourse rate plus fuel and surcharges (importantl=y this option is not locked in and will float with TW s actual rate levels =and fuel retainage percentages)A.  I think the answer here is \"yes.\"  Whatever options we come up with for= 1, 2, and 3, we will always have to offer 4 as well.  Susan and Steve Stoj=ic:  please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated ra=te options and stick to them.  Otherwise, this negotiated rate approach cou=ld get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking ou=r specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations (like a= 7 yr, 231 day contract at $.51764, for example).  I m not sure that would =be a bad thing, but we need to think about it.  We need to be sure we can t=ell a customer \"no\" and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by askin=g for the 5 yr term and the $.35 rate, for example.  I think we can lay out= options of our choosing and then enforce a \"no substitutions\" policy (this= is sticking with the \"cafeteria\" theme) but we need to be sure. =20Q.3.  If we can use the \"cafeteria options\" approach, how much flexibility =do we have in structuring the options? =20A:  This one is hard.  We need to be sure that the price and term we choose= to offer for options 1-3 is solely within our discretion.  We don t want t=o be second guessed by FERC as to whether we should have offered option 1 a=t $.58 instead of $.60.  Susan and Steve: if you guys confirm that we have =discretion in how to structure our negotiated rate options, does that mean =we can slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a bet=ter deal than the recourse option (for most shippers)?  I.e., could we deli=berately  incent shippers to sign on for the short term deals--i.e., by off=ering options 1-3 at $.55, $.45 and $.40 instead of the $.60, $.45, and $.3=5 shown above.  I suspect that is what Guardian and the other pipes did to =obtain 100% subscription under neg. rate deals.           =20Q.4.  How do we allocate capacity to customers if demand exceeds supply???A.  Ideally, we d be able to allocate the 150 to the guys who want to buy i=t the way we d prefer to sell it.  Under the above example, assuming Stan, =Danny and Steve decide short term deals are better, what if we get 100 mm/d= of offers on each of the 4 rate/term options described above.  That s 400 =mm/d of demand for a 150 mm/d project.  Can we sell 100 to the guys who wan=t option 1 ($.60/5 yrs) and the remaining 50 to the 10 yr/$.45 guys?  That =really hoses the recourse bidders.  Do we have to cover the recourse demand= first and then allocate the remaining capacity pro rata to everyone else? = Pro rata to everyone?  Under the rule that negotiated rate bids have to be= deemed to be at max rate for purposes of allocation, pro rata to everyone =may be the right answer.  Or at least its the answer until we ve filled the= recourse rate guys  orders, then we can give the remaining capacity to the= neg. rate guys whose bids we value most highly (using some objective nondi=scriminatory calculation of course).   Ugh.=20Susan and Steve--please take a crack at questions 2-4.  I think 1 is answer=ed already.  I haven t done any research yet, so maybe these questions are =easier than they currently seem to me.

Sorry my earlier correspondence didn t speak clearly enough to these issues.  This is a new electric generation plant.  It doesn t necessarily fall into any existing utility service area, as far as I know.  If anything, it might fall into the City of Famrmington s muni gas service.  However, if the City of Farmington is funding the plant (including  the cost of the interconnect) through muni bonds, it s doubtful they ll have any problem with the source of supply.I m interested in the theory that would necessitate our receiving prior permission to interconnect with a direct end-use customer in any area, uncontested or otherwise.  They ll be building the lateral line (or we ll build it, but they own it).  All we re really doing here is the delivery point.  I understood this situation fits within the FERC s new guidelines for construction of such facilities, and would not require a prior notice filing.Let me know what additional information you might need.---------------------- Forwarded by Jeffery Fawcett/ET&S/Enron on 01/25/2001 09:58 AM ---------------------------   	  From:  Ronald Matthews                           01/25/2001 09:49 AM			To:	Keith Petersen/ET&S/Enron@ENRONcc:	Jeffery Fawcett/ET&S/Enron@ENRON Subject:	Re: Ameramex Project- Bloomfield   Ameramex Energy Farm Project will be a new facility with no current supplier.

They ve recently obtained a City of Farmington pledge of public funds (a precursor to a formal bond issue) to underpin the financing. To refresh your memory, this project is another \"trigeneration\" project.  Ameramex will use the waste steam from the electric generation turbines to heat a hydroponic lettuce farm, as well as use the combustion carbon dioxide.  We ve previously provided a route map and estimate (0.75 mi. of 4\" pipe, $486K direct/indirect cost) to Ameramex.Ameramex s financing deal is now dependent upon completion of the interconnect and commencement of service in approx. 7 months.  To this end, Ameramax has requested a walk through of the potential route and a revised (if necessary) estimate of the cost to interconnect.  There are several other issues to be dealt with here, including what is the final deal structure; including whether TW may possibly providing interim financing until the issuance of the muni bonds.Rick Moore would like to get together with myself and representatives of operations and/or engineering to survey the route and decide on the ultimate design/configuration of facilities.  Depending on the outcome of the survey, he d like a formal proposal for TW for financing the construction of the lateral and interconnect facilities.Ron, since you provided all the prior facility planning support, I d like for you to continue providing the liason support to TW Commercial on this project.  I ll also be calling on the San Juan Team to work with you and engineering to optimize the design/routing of this interconnect/lateral pipeline.  I ll work with the customer to set-up a site meeting when you return to work after 2/5/01.To bring you and others up to speed, I ve included a couple of the original email(s) giving a little more detail on the estimate and a map of the route:Ronald Matthews06/16/2000 03:32 PMTo:	Jeffery Fawcett/ET&S/Enron@ENRONcc:	Terry Galassini/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Rich Jolly/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, David Roensch/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Team San-Juan/ET&S/Enron@ENRON Subject:	Amerimex Energy Farms ProjectJeff,I talked with the San Juan team and came up with a pipeline route to the proposed Energy Farms site located in S1/2  SE1/4  Sec. 13, T29N, R11W, and the NE1/2  NE1/4 Sec. 24, T29N, R11W all in San Juan County, NM.  Per the correspondence, Energy Farms is looking at a delivery around 15 MMcf/d.  The best approach to serving this load would be to take gas from the suction side of Bloomfield CS.  The 4\" pipeline would start there a travel about 0.75 miles to the northwest section of the proposed site (see attached map).  A metering facility would be located at the beginning of the pipeline still inside of TW s property along with the other meter facilities.  Below is a breakdown of the facility cost.  Estimated costs are + 30% and would have to be refined.  0.75 miles of 4\" pipeline & side valve		$286,5004\" orifice meter run w/ gallagher flow 		$199,900conditioner, & flow control						$486,400There is a possibility that the meter facility costs could be lower by using an existing metering header system but a more detailed review would be required.

Rick works for a company called Amerimex.  Rick and I worked together in gas supply at EPNG (\"the early years\").  Amerimex is a developer of \"trigeneration\" projects.  In addition to the subject project for Bloomfield, another one is being considered for Santa Theresa, N.M.  If you recall, we were introduced to trigeneration when we were discussing an electric generation plant on the site of a hydroponic tomato greenhouse near Gallup.Trigeneration is an environmentally friendly technology that utilizes the \"byproducts\" of electric generation.  \"Cogeneration\" refers to the process where waste heat/steam generated during the combustion of gas turbines is sold commercially (usually to manufacturing facilities) for plant purposes.  \"Trigeneration,\" on the other hand, refers the process where not only is the waste heat/steam utilized, but also the carbon dioxide.  Therefore, trigeneration is a perfect fit for a greenhouse that requires both heat and carbon dioxide for the plants.Amerimex has proposed a hydroponic lettuce greenhouse in the Bloomfield, N.M. area.  The facility, to be constructed turnkey by United Technologies, would have a nominal rating of 70 MW, resulting in a gas burn of about 15 MMcf/d.  The plant would require gas deliveries at approx. 500 psig.  The outtake power would be sold both locally and on the grid using a TriStates 69kv transmission line that is proximate to the site.  Given the \"politically correct\" nature of these facilities, the City of Farmington has agreed to fund construction with a $70MM bond.As you can see, we re in the very earliest stages of conversation.  We ll keep the group posted on progress.---------------------- Forwarded by Jeffery Fawcett/ET&S/Enron on 04/18/2000 10:38 AM ---------------------------Jeffery Fawcett04/18/2000 10:38 AMTo:	rmoore01@elp.rr.comcc:	Ronald Matthews/ET&S/Enron@ENRON Subject:	Amerimex Bloomfield ProjectRick,It was really great visiting with you the other day.

The conferencewill be held in St. Louis, MO March 19-21, 2002.  Website iswww.electricpowerexpo.com/ep2002/cfp.html.  Primary attendees areelectric power plant developers, builders, operators, and equipmentsuppliers.One of our proposed speaking topics is \"LNG - a new role in NorthAmerican supply.\" A concern among power generators has been the lack ofdomestic gas supply and pipeline infrastructure to serve growinggas-fired electric generation needs.  The Committee feels LNG can andwill play a more a prominent supply role in the near future.I m looking for an LNG expert who would be willing to give a 15-30minute presentation on the morning of March 20, 2002, 10 - 11:30am.They would be speaking with 2-3 other presenters and then participate ina Q&A session afterward.  After you visit the website, if could let me know if you are interestedin speaking, I will have a formal invitation forwarded to you.

The track and topics weredeveloped over the last 3 months with various inputs from committeemembers and the Trade Fair Group staff.Our current challenge is finding speakers for items 1, 6, and 15(highlighted in red).  If you move your cursor over the topic, thecomment box will appear outlining in a little better detail what info weare trying to present for the conference attendees.I am working on lining up several speakers but as of yet have onlyconfirmed one from Calpine.  What I need each of you to do is review theagenda, think about who you may know who would be a good speaker for thetopic, then call them to see if they are interested.  Speeches shouldlast no more than 30 minutes with a Q&A period afterward.If possible, please email or call me with your results by Friday 10/26.Interested speakers will receive a formal invitation from the Trade FairGroup confirming their attendance.Thanks for your help.

Power plant developers have responded aggressively to thepower crisis in the West and the potential for power shortages in theMidwest and Northeast, according to a report, New Coal-Fired Generation: TheRace Is On, by Boulder, Colo.-based RDI Consulting.Using data compiled by RDI, a data division of Platts, the report estimatesthe U.S. will require 296,000 MW of capacity additions by 2015 to meetgrowing demand and to replace older units likely to retire. This compareswith roughly 780,000 MW of installed capacity in the U.S. today. RDI also projects that almost 60% of the required capacity will be built bythe end of 2006 and, despite extreme volatility in natural gas prices, themajority of this new capacity will be gas-fired-equaling nearly 170,000 MW.Because of that fact, for developers looking to build coal-fired plants, therace has turned into a marathon. The advantage of proposed coal-fired generation is the potential for lowdispatch costs. Hypothetical plants modeled by RDI in all areas of thecountry show new coal-fired generation can dispatch well ahead of gas-firedplants and somewhat ahead of most existing coal-fired plants. Disadvantages of new coal-fired generation are higher initial capital costsand greater risk, which means that new coal-fired plants are susceptible todepressed market prices that could result from overbuilding new capacity.Developers will have two choices in the near term if coal plants are tosucceed: wait out the surge of capacity development and be prepared to enterthe market later in the decade when the excess capacity is absorbed; orsecure long term power sales agreements and capacity contracts that willprovide enough revenue to cover the high development costs of a new coalplant.

OPEC is currently lobbyingRussia to make a more significant contribution to a planned OPEC/non-OPECround of output cuts than the 50,000 barrels per day pledged by Moscow latelast week. OPEC agreed at its Nov. 14 meeting to reduce crude output by 1.5million barrels per day, but only if non-OPEC producers contribute a further500,000 barrels per day reduction. Mexico has said it is willing to cut by100,000 barrels per day, while Norway said last week it would cut by100,000-200,000 barrels per day, as long as other producers honor their cutpledges.Nordic to build power plant, ethanol facility in OhioNordic Energy plans to develop the first new coal-fired baseload project inOhio in more than a decade, an 850-MW merchant plant in the northeast partof the state, the company said Tuesday. The coal plant, which would utilizeintegrated gasification combined cycle technology, would be a cogenerationfacility that also would produce steam to run an ethanol production plantthat affiliated Nordic Biofuels intends to build nearby. Nordic Energy willinitiate an anticipated 18-month permitting process for the coal plant earlynext year. Commercial operation is expected in June 2006. The coal plant isexpected to cost about $1 billion, and the ethanol facility about $150million. \"We decided this is the time to build our own plant and moveforward,\" said Joni Fixel, Nordic Energy director of power supply.To subscribe to our Executive News Service, which is updated twice daily,log on to http://www.energyinsight.com, or contact Platt s Direct ResponseTeam at 1-800-424-2908 (if outside the United States call 1-720-548-5700).///////////////////////////////////////////////","KHYATT (Non-Privileged)Hyatt, KevinInbox"

We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm s length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).

(Tampa Electric) have formed a partnership to build, own, and operate a 2300 Mw gas-fired electric generation plant located in Maricopa County, Arizona, southwest of Phoenix.  The partnership may be called \"Panda Gila River L.P.\"Here are some of the details as we know them:	All building/ air permits received, construction has commenced	Financing closed 6/04/01 (oversubscribed by 56%)	$2.2 bn loan ($1.7bn 5 yr. bullet loan and $500mm equity bridge)	Financing led by Citibank and Societe Generale	50% of power output sold under long term contracts, 50% on spot marketWhat we want to know is:	How did the banks get comfortable on the financing if only 25% of the gas pipeline transport capacity is under contract?

Additionally, it is an opportunity for each of us to provide meaningful performance feedback to help others.  This memo is intended to summarize the major elements of this important process and clarify the timeline for year-end 2001.(Note: ETS employees on self-directed work teams that participate in the Skill-based Pay program will complete team and peer performance reviews as they have in the past and are exempted from the discussion that follows.)Feedback and EvaluationEmployees will solicit 360? feedback on their performance via the PEP system. The supervisor will use this feedback, along with other performance data about the employee, to prepare a written evaluation of the employee s performance for the year.  The employee and supervisor will then meet and discuss this evaluation which provides an objective measure of the employee s performance against expectations.  The performance evaluation is an opportunity to discuss accomplishments, areas for improvement and goals for the next year.  No overall performance rating will be designated.?	PEP System open for feedback			November 19 - December 7?	Performance discussions with supervisor	December 10 - January 14?	Written evaluations due to HR			January 15Training for all employees on how to use the PEP system will be available via online tutorials.CompensationIncreases in an employee s base pay for merit, promotion or equity can be recommended by an individual supervisor based on the employee s performance, current responsibilities and salary.  Division Head approval is required.As always, incentive awards are paid at the discretion of the Enron Board Compensation Committee and the Enron Office of the Chairman based on company and business unit performance. Once bonus pools are approved, individual bonuses will be determined by division and department heads based on employee performance.Relative Talent ReviewsRelative talent reviews will occur beginning January 16, 2002 and will include discussions of Managers and above.  The focus is not on relative ranking but on identifying employees who best demonstrate the performance, skills and behaviors that are valued at Enron.  Each Division will identify its top 10% and discuss the utilization of its top talent.  Employees who may be ready to assume greater responsibilities will be discussed.  Recommendations for promotions will be considered up through Senior Director.  EGS executive management will review Vice Presidents and Managing Directors and identify the top 10% in this officer group.  Nomination for promotions to Vice President and Managing Director levels will be made to the Enron Management Committee, which will make final decisions on these promotions.If you have any questions about any aspect of this year-end process, I encourage you to contact your HR representative.Gary","KHYATT (Non-Privileged)Hyatt, KevinInbox"

The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. s pipelines may not be as sexy as the company s self-touted ability to create lucrative commodity markets, but they aren t bankrupt. Pipelines and power plants are the company s main source of steady income these days. They also will be at the core of the humbled Enron that officials hope will emerge - with a new name - from the largest bankruptcy in history.\"It s going to be an uphill battle in persuading the creditors that it s a reorganizable platform,\" restructuring specialist Stephen Cooper, Enron s interim chief executive, said in a voicemail Friday to employees. \"We ve got a tremendous sales job in front of us,\" Cooper said. Earlier this month Swiss investment bank UBS Warburg launched a new trading operation, UBS Warburg Energy, with a work force comprised mostly of about 625 former Enron traders and support staff. UBS Warburg paid nothing up front for what used to be the source of most of Enron s income but agreed to give Enron 33 percent of the new organization s profits. Enron agreed before filing for bankruptcy in December to sell its Portland General Electric Co. utility to Portland, Ore.-based Northwest Natural Gas Co. The utility will remain a revenue generator for Enron until the sale closes in the third or fourth quarter this year. Enron is trying to unload money-losing ventures, such as its broadband unit with its 18,000-mile fiber optic network. This week the company sold its wind power subsidiary to General Electric Co. for an undisclosed price, and its oil and gas assets in India to Britian s BG Group PLC for $350 million. While Houston-based Dynegy, Inc. last month acquired Enron s largest asset, the 16,500-mile Northern Natural Gas pipeline, Enron still operates 11,000 miles of other pipelines in the U.S. that aren t part of its bankruptcy, spokesman John Ambler said. He said the company has yet to decide what to sell among its international power, oil and gas assets, but operations in Brazil and Bolivia are the most likely keepers, he said. \"These are ongoing operations that are not party to the bankruptcy and they are all bringing in good returns and cash flows,\" Ambler said. John McCormack, senior vice president and head of the energy practice at New York corporate financial advisor Stern Stewart & Co., said Friday Enron creditors stand to get more cents on the dollar if they accept equity in those assets with the reorganized company. \"I have no doubt that there are significant pieces of Enron businesses that are worth a lot more alive than dead,\" McCormack said. Anthony Sabino, a bankruptcy professor specializing in oil and gas law at St. John s University School of Law, said the pipelines and power operations may appear pitiful next to the billions of dollars in debt owed to Enron s 800-plus creditors. But they are steady. \"It may not be flashy, but that s good money that comes in month after month,\" Sabino said. \"Chances are creditors will go for something like cash up front, some payments over time and probably a lot of equity in the newly reorganized company.\" A key element to Enron s survival is whether workers at those operations stick with the company through bankruptcy. Enron officials Friday presented a plan to pay retention bonuses and severance packages to current employees to the creditors committee, according to Cooper s voicemail. If approved, he said the plan will later be presented to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez. \"At the moment I can t make any assurances relative to ongoing employment, and certainly there s nothing I can do to replace what many of you have lost,\" Cooper told employees. Enron imploded last year amid revelations of accounting abuses and financial partnerships used to hide debt and inflate profits. More than one-fifth of the company s workforce of 25,000 abruptly was laid off, and workers with 401(k) accounts loaded with Enron stock evaporated when shares dropped to less than a dollar. In addition to a new name - which has yet to be determined - Enron is planning to find new digs in the next year or two to match its pared-down needs, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. Enron leases the 50-story glass tower in downtown Houston that houses its headquarters. The company owns, and has for sale, a new $200 million, 40-story glass tower across the street, Palmer said. UBS Warburg Energy is leasing two trading floors in the new building. Enron s Houston workforce dwindled to less than 3,000 after 4,500 workers were laid off after the bankruptcy filing and others have since quit. That leaves a lot of empty space on near-empty floors, Palmer said. Enron isn t shopping for smaller offices yet but Cooper said remaining workers will soon be consolidated. \"We can all be together, and people aren t going to be lonely and hanging out there occupying little spaces on big floors,\" he told workers.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(Refiles with new slug, previous UTILITIES-FERC-ENRON) By Chris Baltimore WASHINGTON, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Under fire from U.S. lawmakers for being too cozy with Enron Corp. , the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said in a letter released on Friday that its commissioners and senior staff members had contact 25 times with the bankrupt company s executives between August 2000 and June 2001. The meetings did not include new FERC Chairman Pat Wood, who is facing criticism that he was too close to the bankrupt energy giant. Deflecting criticism, Wood denied that Enron \"has had any undue influence on the decision-making process\" at FERC. \"The agency s decisions have not been compromised or otherwise improperly shaped\" by Enron contacts, he wrote in a letter to California Senator Barbara Boxer made available on Friday. Enron, once the seventh-largest U.S. corporation whose stock was a Wall Street darling, spent lavishly on lobbyists who championed restructuring legislation. Former Enron Chairman Ken Lay urged President George W. Bush to appoint Wood to his current position. Enron also backed Wood s previous appointment as the head of the Public Utility Commission of Texas. Rep. Henry Waxman of California has also asked Wood to disclose his Enron contacts. Last week, Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell wrote to urge Wood to resign. The time period of Boxer s inquiry \"effectively predates my tenure,\" Wood wrote, pegging his arrival at the agency on June 5, 2001. Wood became chairman in September. Wood s letter was in response to a request Boxer made on January 31. In a response to Wood s letter, Boxer said that \"decision makers at FERC were wined and dined by Enron both in Washington and Texas in an obvious effort ... to control all aspects of America s energy policy.\" NUMEROUS MEETINGS CITED As evidence, Boxer pointed to numerous meetings between Enron officials and FERC staff, including FERC commissioners Linda Breathitt and William Massey, both Democratic nominees to the commission, and senior FERC officials. Republican Nora Brownell, also a target of criticism for her support of electricity deregulation while a Pennsylvania utility commissioner, reported no Enron contact. In the letter, Wood described various meetings with Enron officials to discuss electricity deregulation and other issues, and some FERC officials toured Enron s trading floor in Houston. During the period in question, Boxer accused FERC of sitting idly by while power shortages swept the state, leading to blackouts and soaring power bills for consumers. Ironically, Wood and Brownell voted to support price limits on the California market, a position opposed by Enron and Curt Hebert, the previous FERC chairman. Boxer also said FERC officials could have violated the Administrative Procedure Act and its own ethics guidelines which restrict contact between federal officials and industry representatives involved in contentious issues. Wood said that one of his first acts as chairman was to order ethics training for all FERC staff, and said he has \"stressed strict compliance with the Federal government s ethics rules,\" including the Administrative Procedure Act. Responding to Boxer s statement, a FERC spokesman denied any improper actions by any agency officials. \"What is not permitted is to talk to a company about a contested or on-the-record proceeding and to my knowledge we have played by the rules,\" he said. \"We would be remiss in our duties if from time to time the regulators didn t talk to one of the largest owners of gas pipelines in the United States,\" he said. Wood has had three contacts with Enron officials while at FERC, including a call from Enron s Lay on Nov. 11, which he did not return, the spokesman said. Lay made the call two days after Enron agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc. for $9 billion, a deal Dynegy later scuttled. FERC said its contact with Enron included: * Linda K. Breathitt, commissioner: met five times with Enron executives including Rick Shapiro, Enron s managing director of government affairs. Discussion included general electricity deregulation, regional transmission organizations, transmission access issues and tariff reform * Daniel L. Larcamp, director of markets, tariffs and rates: met five times with FERC officials, including former Enron chief executive Jeff Skilling; toured Enron trading floor twice in July and December 2000, met with Stan Horton of Enron Pipeline Group, Shapiro. * William Massey, commissioner: met six times with Enron officials, including Stan Horton (then also serving as chair of the Gas Industry Standards Board), and Eugene Lockhart, president of Enron unit New Power Co.; \"perhaps\" had telephone call with Skilling.Paper - Nuon interested in taking over from Azurix .02/22/2002 Business News Americas Copyright 1996 - 2002 Business News Americas (BNamericas.com) Azurix Corp.AZXNuon Dutch energy and water company Nuon could take over from Argentina s Buenos Aires province waterworks concessionaire Azurix BA, when the latter s contract ends March 2, according to Argentine paper El Cronista citing unnamed Azurix sources. A Nuon spokesperson neither confirmed nor denied the reports when contacted by BNamericas. The spokesperson did not comment further, and said the company is not aware of the press report. An announcement is expected in the coming days regarding the future of the province s waterworks services, and until a definite course of action is taken, the province will take over as service provider. Azurix was to have stepped down January 2.

SINGAPORE -(Dow Jones)- U.K. oil and gas company BG Group PLC (BRG) will more than double its investment in India over the next three to five years, the company s Indian unit said Monday. BG will raise its investment to US$1.3 billion from the estimated US$500 million it currently holds, targeting the upstream oil and gas sector and the liquified natural gas business. BG is expanding its presence in India through its Indian unit - British Gas India Pvt. It recently acquired Enron Corp. s (ENRNQ) upstream oil and gas assets for US$350 million and is developing an LNG import terminal at Pipavav port in the western Indian state of Gujarat. BG also holds stakes in two Indian gas distribution companies. It is a majority stakeholder in Gujarat Gas Company Ltd. (P.GCC) and joint venture partner in Mahanagar Gas Ltd. holding 50% equity. Separately, a BG India spokesman said the company is expected to drill its first exploratory well in the CB-OS/1 block offshore Gujarat this week. BG will drill a further two exploratory wells on the CB-OS/1 block. BG plans to invest about US$18 million in the CB-OS/1 exploration block by November this year. BG acquired Enron s 62.64% interest in the CB-OS/1 block last year as part of its US$350 million deal for Enron s 30% stake in the Tapti gas field and Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields offshore Gujarat. Although BG finalized earlier this month a renegotiated deal to buy Enron s upstream oil and gas assets in India, its dispute with state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (P.ONG) over who will manage the offshore fields remains unresolved. -By Sri Jegarajah, Dow Jones Newswires; 65-415-4066; sri.jegarajah@dowjones.comSINGAPORE: Enron Japan s creditors may be left empty-handed.02/25/2002 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2002. SINGAPORE, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Creditors to Enron s Japanese units could be left in the cold as the company s assets may cover little more than the cost of liquidation, a source said Monday. Creditors will meet with the administrator of Enron assets on March 27 to find out what, if any, money will be repaid, a source involved in the liquidation process told Reuters by telephone from Tokyo. \"After that meeting the distribution of the assets to creditors would occur, if there are any. But the prospects are not great. There are not many assets,\" the source said. Creditors to Enron Japan Corp are seeking around three billion yen ($22.4 million), the source said. Enron Japan and three other Japanese affiliates of the former U.S. energy giant filed for bankruptcy in early December, one week after the parent company filed for largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. The other units are Enron Japan Marketing Corp, Enron Japan Funding Corp and E Power Corp. The company s 70-to-80 employees have one month s salary, or about 60 to 70 million yen ($449,000 to $523,000) coming to them. \"The employee claims for salary and bonuses take first priority,\" the source said. Enron s Japanese assets consist of mostly office equipment and a modest bank deposit, with the value of the company s office lease worth little more than the cost of termination, the source said. \"The costs to close the office could exceed the overall assets,\" the source said. The value of Enron Japan s assets will be revealed at the creditors meeting. The source said Enron s Japanese trading system cost about two billion yen ($15 million) to build, but cannot be sold to generate cash. \"The trading system can t be sold because it is based on the U.S. system, and they have not given their approval for its sale here in Japan,\" the source said. Enron established a foothold in Japan in 1999 and operated various trading and marketing units in the energy and commodities industries. The company had announced plans to build large thermal power plants at four different sites in Japan, but those projects did not leave the drawing table. ($1=133.75 yen).Enron Got $1.2B In Loans From US Agencies For Pwr Plants02/24/2002 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) WASHINGTON (AP)--As Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) reached for markets overseas, power plants it helped build from Guatemala to India received $1.2 billion in government-backed loans from two U.S. agencies. The Overseas Private Investment Corp. still is owed $453 million from the Enron-related projects while the Export-Import Bank is due $512 million. \"They re definitely among our top 10 borrowers,\" OPIC spokesman Larry Spinelli said. Though Enron is now bankrupt, four of its projects financed by OPIC are making its payments on time. Regarding a fifth project, Enron and two other U.S. corporations are seeking to have OPIC pay off a huge insurance claim. When it filed for bankruptcy in December, Enron was pursuing OPIC help on two more projects in Brazil. Those applications have been abandoned. Enron s relationship with the government is part of a two-pronged business strategy. Inside the U.S., Enron has sought to free energy companies from government regulation. Internationally, Enron has embraced Washington s help in the form of federally backed loans and insurance protection. The irony is not lost on congressional critics. OPIC \"gave hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and other support to Enron-related projects during the Clinton administration,\" said Sen. Charles Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee who recently obtained records showing Enron-related projects received $544 million in loans from OPIC. Separately, the Ex-Im Bank made more than $650 million in loans to Enron-related projects overseas. \"These projects obviously were a tremendous benefit to Enron s operation. The disclosure of this information sheds light on the government s actions in support of Enron over the years,\" Grassley added. Enron s bankruptcy does not place the loans in jeopardy. Separately created corporations handled the overseas projects for Enron and other U.S. companies. OPIC and Ex-Im loans are backed with the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Though it has just 200 employees, OPIC has deep pockets - a $4 billion reserve that comes from the user fees U.S. businesses pay for its loans and insurance. OPIC operates at no net cost to U.S. taxpayers - the business fees cover its costs - and earned $215 million last year. OPIC s loan and insurance portfolio totals $14 billion; the Ex-Im Bank s portfolio exposure is $62 billion. A financially troubled Enron plant in India - financed in part with OPIC loans - is cited by congressional critics who say the company has gotten too much government help. OPIC provided $160 million to Enron and two other corporations to help build the $2.9 billion Dabhol plant. It now stands idle because prospective customers do not want the power. The Ex-Im bank says it is still owed $203 million on the India project, but that it can call on guarantees from five Indian financial institutions for repayment if necessary. Enron and the other two companies filed an insurance claim in December asking OPIC to pay $200 million. The claim is based on \"political risk insurance\" bought at the outset of the Dabhol project. The companies say the Indian government has broken promises to stand behind the project, in effect denying the U.S. corporations their asset and therefore requiring OPIC to pay the insurance policy. The claims process will take months to resolve. The other four Enron projects that got OPIC money are operating successfully and are paying back their loans in a timely fashion. The payback comes from the revenue coming into the operating power plants. Those power plants are in the Philippines, Turkey, Venezuela and Guatemala. The Ex-Im Banks Enron-related projects are in Colombia and at the same plants that OPIC is helping in Turkey and Venezuela. Enron s bankruptcy stopped two OPIC applications in their tracks: two power projects in Brazil that would have received $390 million in OPIC loans. UK s BG CEO To Raise Field Mgmt Row With India Govt Tue02/25/2002 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) SINGAPORE -(Dow Jones)- Frank Chapman, chief executive of U.K. oil and gas company BG Group PLC (BRG), will raise a dispute over the management of Enron Corp. s (ENRNQ) recently-acquired Indian upstream assets when he meets Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Ram Naik Tuesday, government and industry sources said late Monday. \"That should definitely come up,\" said a New Delhi-based Petroleum Ministry source, referring to BG s dispute with India s state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (P.ONG) on the management rights, or operatorship, of Enron s offshore oil and gas fields. Earlier this month, BG finalized a renegotiated deal to buy Enron s 30% equity stake in the offshore Panna, Mukta and Tapti oil and natural gas fields located off India s western coast for $350 million. However, BG s dispute with Oil & Natural Gas Corp. over who ultimately manages the offshore fields is still unresolved. Under the new deal with Enron, BG said the management of the offshore oil and gas fields was no longer a precondition for the acquisition. Although this represented a reversal from its previous position, when it insisted on managing the fields, BG said it wasn t bowing out of the management race. A BG India spokesman said Chapman would arrive Tuesday for a two-day visit, but stressed that the talks would address broad areas. \"There s no definite agenda. The purpose of the visit is to meet people in the government, BG India staff and top-ranking officials in different companies to talk about current investments and future plans,\" the spokesman said. A source close to BG said the management rights issue would be addressed in an \"appropriate forum,\" but was unable to elaborate. \"I m sure it (the management dispute) is going to come up in various meetings, but it wouldn t be correct to label his (Chapman s) visit purely on that basis,\" the source said.      A spokeswoman at BG s U.K. headquarters in Reading said the company held \"ongoing discussions\" with BG s joint venture partners Oil & Natural Gas Corp. and Reliance Industries Ltd. (P.REL) on the management rights issue. She couldn t comment on the status of the discussions as talks were \"commercially confidential.\" Although Oil & Natural Gas Corp. is eager to clinch the management, the company remained open to alternative offers. BG has offered cash and equity stakes in upstream acreages overseas to Oil & Natural Gas Corp. to secure the management rights, but the latter has rejected these offers. Friday, India s Financial Express reported BG \"will shortly be making a final offer\" to its joint venture partners Oil & Natural Gas Corp. and Reliance Industries to take over the management of the Mukta, Panna, and Tapti oil and gas fields. BG declined to comment on the report. BG is expanding its presence in India through its Indian unit - British Gas India Pvt. The company is developing an LNG import terminal at Pipavav port in the western Indian state of Gujarat. BG also holds stakes in two Indian gas distribution companies. It is a majority stakeholder in Gujarat Gas Company Ltd.

Associated Press WASHINGTON -- The Senate is ready to take up broad energy legislation that has caused splits over drilling in Alaska s Arctic National Wildlife refuge, automobile gas mileage, and electricity competition in the shadow of Enron Corp. s collapse. Debate expected this week comes nine months after President Bush outlined his plan to increase the nation s energy supply by expanding oil and gas drilling on public land, particularly in ANWR, and rejuvenating nuclear power. The House passed its version, but in the Senate, majority Democrats have offered legislation that relies more heavily on conservation. The crisis atmosphere has all but disappeared: Energy prices are low, and supplies are plentiful. The urgency to act may have lost steam, say lawmakers and lobbyists. President Bush, in a weekend push to promote his plan, dismissed claims that it focuses too much on fossil fuel production and not enough on conservation and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. \"Conservation technology and renewables are important. Yet they alone cannot solve our energy problems,\" he said in his weekly radio address. During his recent trip to Asia, Mr. Bush stopped in Alaska, where he again stressed the need to drill for oil in ANWR. The idea won mention in his Saturday broadcast, with the president saying drilling can go ahead without hurting the environment, while also providing jobs. Environmentalists have pledged to protect ANWR, and some Senate Democrats say they will stall energy legislation if Republicans press the refuge drilling issue -- as most expect them to do. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D., S.D.), has offered a broad proposal that senators probably will consider this week. \"We have a real opportunity here,\" Mr. Daschle said Sunday on ABC s \"This Week.\" \"There are some big differences between what the Republicans are proposing, which is really the policies of the past, and what the Democrats are proposing, which is a real look to a future for energy policy that is vastly different and exciting.\" At least two weeks of debate are predicted. There are \"a lot of ways ... this legislation might go off the rails,\" said Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D., N.M.), a principal architect of the Democratic bill. The House bill, strongly endorsed by Republicans and the White House, tilts toward expanding energy production and would allow ANWR exploration. It also offers billions of dollars in tax subsidies to producers. Senate Democrats reject drilling in the refuge and emphasize conservation: sharp increases in fuel economy for automobiles, tougher federal energy efficiency standards and greater support for renewable fuels and natural gas, as opposed to oil. Tax breaks in the Democratic proposal -- about $16 billion worth, or roughly half of what the House has offered -- lean more toward conservation and renewable fuel sources as opposed to the oil, gas and nuclear industries focused on in the House version. Sen. Frank Murkowski (R., Alaska), says drilling in the refuge is essential to lessen U.S. dependence on foreign oil. He plans an amendment that would give oil companies access to the refuge s coastal plain, where billions of barrels of oil might be available. Sen. Murkowski says he has the majority needed to get it passed, but -- at least not yet -- the 60 votes needed to overcome a sure filibuster. Other issues also could scuttle a potential compromise: -- Automobile mileage. A Democratic proposal would increase fuel economy by 30%, to an average of 35 miles per gallon by 2013, and remove lower standards now given to sport utility vehicles. Currently, new automobiles are required to meet a fleet average of 27.5 mpg and SUVs and minivans 20.7 mpg. -- Ethanol. Farm interests and the oil industry are fighting over whether to increase the use of corn-based ethanol as a motor fuel by establishing a \"renewable fuels\" requirements for gasoline. -- The $16 billion in tax breaks over 10 years. A Democratic version would give more of the money to conservation. Republican proposals tilt toward helping producers. -- Electricity competition. With Enron s bankruptcy fresh in their minds, senators will consider how much say the federal government should have over siting transmission lines, managing power grids and monitoring the business practices of large energy holding companies. The bill Mr. Daschle is introducing may attract more than 200 amendments. \"The big question is whether along the way the bill gets killed because it s just too big and cumbersome,\" says Dan Becker of the Sierra Club. \"The conventional wisdom is that this is a bill that s just too heavy to fly.\" With so many contested issues, David Owens of the Edison Electric Institute thinks the bill will bog down. The Edison group s member utilities want repeal -- as the bill provides -- of a Depression-era law that restricts the activities of utility holding companies. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, Republicans have stepped up the argument that more domestic oil production is needed to enhance national security by reducing America s reliance on Middle East oil. Drilling foes counter that the refuge doesn t hold enough oil to reduce imports significantly and that tougher fuel economy standards for vehicles would go further in lessening U.S. dependence on foreign sources. While Congress works on the legislation, its investigative arm has sued Vice President Dick Cheney to force the release of industry figures who met with his task force as its developed the administration s energy plan. The White House has refused to hand over the information, contending that doing so would encroach on the president s ability to get candid views from people outside government. Copyright (c) 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. California Governor Considers Delaying Phasing Out Gas Additive MTBEBy Alexei Barrionuevo02/22/2002 Dow Jones Business News (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gray Davis said he is considering delaying a ban on MTBE and would make a final decision within the next 40 days. The governor s comments, first made at a press conference on Thursday, follow the release earlier this week of an outside economic analysis that contends the state could face \"prolonged shortages\" of gasoline and severe price spikes if it goes through with a plan to replace MTBE with ethanol. MTBE, a petrochemical, is also known as methyl tertiary-butyl ether. A spokesman for the governor told The Wall Street Journal on Friday that Gov. Davis hopes to decide in the next 40 days whether to delay the ban until 2005. The governor is concerned the state needs more time to put in place the infrastructure it needs to store and ship the ethanol into California from the Midwest, where most of the country s ethanol is produced, the spokesman said. A report by Stillwater Associates, an oil-refining consulting firm, recommended delaying the switchover until November of 2005 to give the state adequate time to increase gasoline supplies. The report, presented to the California Energy Commission on Tuesday, said California lacked storage tanks and fuel terminals, particularly in Southern California, that could handle an influx of imported gasoline to make up a gasoline shortage expected to be as great as 5% to 10% of demand. The consulting firm suggested restarting idle refining capacity, extending a Texas gasoline pipeline to Phoenix and building more fuel terminals and tank capacity in both Northern and Southern California. Gov. Davis ordered a ban on MTBE in 1999 because of concern that it contaminates groundwater. A federal mandate requires the country s most heavily polluted regions to add oxygenates like MTBE and ethanol to gasoline to reduce pollution. After ordering the ban, Gov. Davis, a Democrat, requested a waiver from the 1990 Clean Air Amendments requiring most states  gasoline to include a certain percentage of oxygenates. Both ethanol and MTBE are blended into reformulated gasoline to make it burn more cleanly, reducing smog. Gov. Davis contends studies show that the state s refiners can meet clean-air requirements without using any oxygenate. But the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rejected the governor s waiver request last year. That has left the state with only one alternative to MTBE -- ethanol. Given California s dependence on cars, the state would need 580 million gallons of ethanol a year, or one-third of total U.S. production. Gov. Davis on Thursday blamed \"politics in the Midwest\" for the rejection of California s waiver request.","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinInboxEnron News"

SINGAPORE -(Dow Jones)- Financiers of Enron Corp. s (ENE) US$2.9 billion Indian power unit, the Dabhol Power Co., described two-day talks that concluded in Singapore Thursday as \"productive,\" according to a statement issued Friday. \"The meetings were productive and a plan of action is being developed,\" said the statement from the steering committee representing Dabhol s international lenders. \"The meetings were confidential in nature, and therefore no further detail can be provided,\" it said. Dabhol s Indian and foreign lenders were meeting behind closed doors earlier this week to discuss ways to revive the ailing power project. Dabhol, the largest foreign investment project in India, has been mired in conflict since 1995 due to payment disputes with its sole customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. Lenders to the beleaguered company are keen to find a buyer for the 85% foreign equity, which includes Enron s 65% controlling stake.      Earlier this week, A.K. Doda, executive director of the Industrial Development Bank of India (P.IDB), told Dow Jones Newswires the lenders  meeting would finalize a due-diligence time frame for prospective buyers of Dabhol s foreign-held equity. A source close to the international lenders suggested further lenders  meetings in the future. \"We are still in productive dialogue, but where and when there will be meetings has not been decided,\" the source said. \"It s natural to expect that there will be follow-up meetings at some stage,\" he added. India s Tata Power Co. (P.TPW), BSES Ltd. (P.BSX), U.K. s BG Group PLC (BRG), Gaz de France (F.GAF), the Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD) and India s largest gas distributor and marketer, the state-owned Gas Authority of India Ltd. (P.GAI), have expressed interest in bidding for Dabhol s foreign equity. Dabhol s domestic lenders include IDBI, ICICI Ltd. (IC), IFCI Ltd. (P.ICI) and the State Bank of India (P.SBI). Loans by foreign lenders - including investing bank ABN Amro, Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Citigroup Inc. (C) - are backed by government guarantees. Domestic lenders  loans aren t. Aside from Enron s 65% controlling stake, Dabhol s remaining foreign equity is held by General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel (X.BTL), who each hold a 10% stake. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board holds the remaining 15%.    -By Sri Jegarajah, Dow Jones Newswires; 65-415-4066; sri.jegarajah@dowjones.comJeb Bush Had Profit on Enron UnitApril Witt02/22/2002 The Washington Post FINAL Page A04 Copyright 2002, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved Florida Gov. Jeb Bush invested in a publicly traded Enron Corp. partnership in 1995 and turned a modest profit before selling it less than a year later. Bush invested $91,527 in Enron Liquids Pipeline LP in February 1995 and realized a profit of just $7,118 when he sold it 10 months later, according to his 1995 tax returns. Justice Department and congressional investigators and securities regulators are investigating the role Enron s off-the-books partnerships played in the company s collapse last fall, in which thousands of people lost their jobs and life savings. One of the biggest single losers was Florida s pension fund. The focus is on partnerships run by former Enron chief financial officer Andrew S. Fastow, none of which were publicly traded. Former Enron president Richard Kinder -- who recently hosted a $500-a-person political fundraiser for Bush in Houston -- now controls Enron Liquids Pipeline. Kinder and a partner bought it for $40 million in 1997, and it became the basis for Kinder Morgan Energy Partners. Bush did not know Kinder at the time he invested in the partnership, Katie Baur, the governor s spokeswoman, said yesterday. At the time, Bush was a businessman who had just lost an election for the Florida governorship. Baur said he invested in Enron Liquids Pipeline on advice from his broker at Charles Schwab Corp. -- not insider information about the future sale. \"Why not this investment?\" Baur said. \"Any Joe Schmo citizen could have walked in off the street and requested to invest in Enron Liquid Pipelines.\" Still, Baur said that she expects Democrats to try to capitalize on Bush s investment in Enron Liquid Pipelines. \"Admittedly, anything with the word Enron in it is incendiary,\" she said. \"You could look at this backward and forward, but the facts are pretty simple. He made one investment and made $7,000 . . . This isn t like Hillary Clinton s cattle futures here.\" http://www.washingtonpost.com Contact: http://www.washingtonpost.com Enron has deal to sell wind unit / GE purchasing one of largest assets leftERIC BERGER02/21/2002 Houston Chronicle 3 STAR Page 6 (Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle) Enron agreed Wednesday to sell to General Electric Co. its California-based wind-turbine unit, one of its largest remaining assets that could be used to pay creditors. Terms of the deal for the largest U.S. manufacturer of wind turbines were not disclosed, but an attorney familiar with it said it was worth $250 million in cash, and GE agreed to assume more than $100 million in debt and other obligations. GE s Power Systems unit will acquire Enron Wind s turbine- manufacturing operation. Last year the company had nearly $800 million in worldwide sales and 1,500 employees. Enron will retain control of six wind farms it owns or operates in the United States, and three in Europe. The deal still must be approved by federal regulators and New York bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez. Enron Wind was one of three major assets the company can sell that do not have liens. For that reason they have been closely watched by the company s unsecured creditors, who are owed billions. The unit filed for bankruptcy court protection Wednesday, joining dozens of other Enron subsidiaries in the Enron Corp. case before Gonzalez. This will allow GE to complete the sale free of creditors  claims. GE said it expected the sale to close in April 2002. Gonzalez has already approved the sale of Enron s oil and gas fields in India, Enron Oil & Gas Ltd., to the British company BG Group for $350 million. The third asset that can be sold is Portland General Electric Co. Its sale to Northwest Natural Gas Co. for $2.9 billion is expected to be approved by regulators by year s end. The wind unit, founded in 1981 as Zond Corp., was acquired in 1997 by Enron. The new owner will be able to invest much needed capital to fund Enron Wind s expansion which Enron could no longer provide, said Stanley Horton, chairman and CEO of Enron Global Services, Enron Wind s parent company. Wind industry advocates hailed the sale. \"We re very excited about it,\" said Randy Swisher, executive director of American Wind Energy Association. \"It s one more indication that wind energy technology has finally come of age.\" Swisher welcomed GE s entry into the wind energy business, which has doubled nationally about every three years, he said. Several wind projects in Texas, including a 220-megawatt site in Culberson County, a 161-megawatt site in Pecos County serving San Antonio and a 150-megawatt site in Nolan and Taylor counties, use Enron Wind turbines. A 150-megawatt site can power up to 75,000 homes.Feb. 21, 2002, 9:52PMEnron unit investment made profit for Jeb Bush Associated Press WASHINGTON -- Jeb Bush invested about $91,000 and turned a small profit in 1995 from an Enron partnership, tax records indicate. The enterprise now is controlled by a former Enron president who has been helping the Florida governor raise money for his re-election bid. Bush s investment in Enron Liquids L.P. three years before he became governor is the only known investment by a member of President Bush s immediate family in an Enron partnership. Investigators have been looking at some of Enron s privately traded partnerships as contributors to the company s collapse. Enron Liquids, however, was publicly traded and is not part of the investigation. Jeb Bush s investment brought him a $7,000 profit, according to his 1995 tax return. \"It was an investment for less than a year and it was done long before last year s bankruptcy,\" the governor said this week. President Bush said last month that his mother-in-law was among Enron Corp. stockholders who lost money on the failed company -- about $8,100. Spokeswoman Katie Baur said Thursday the Jeb Bush investment was chosen for him by an investment advisory firm. Democrats eager to defeat the president s brother in the fall election are trying to make an issue of his ties to Enron. In a state whose pension fund lost more than $300 million in the collapse, Bush s fund-raising trip to the Houston home of former Enron president Richard Kinder \"rubs in the face of people who lost their life savings,\" the chairman of the Florida Democratic Party said last month. The Bush camp said it saw no problem, since Kinder left Enron in 1996. Aside from the two fund-raisers, the two men have had infrequent contact, said Larry Pierce, a spokesman for Kinder s energy company. The two men have run into each other occasionally at public events and they have never had any business relationship, he added. Kinder \"hosted these fund-raisers as a favor to the Republican Party,\" said Pierce. \"What Democrats are doing nationally in trying to capitalize on the suffering of Enron employees for their own cheap political gain is absolutely shameful,\" said Karen Unger, the governor s campaign manager. She called it \"an act of sheer desperation\" by the Democrats. Bush released his tax return four years ago. Kinder s latest event for Bush was a $500-per-person fund-raiser on Jan. 17 for about 100 political donors at Kinder s home. Kinder is a longtime political supporter of the Bush family and the Republican Party with contributions totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars dating to 1988. In 1997 after leaving Enron, Kinder and a partner paid $40 million for the general partnership that ran Enron Liquids, a pipeline network carrying liquid natural gas. Kinder, Enron s president from 1990 to 1996, was the heir apparent to Chairman Ken Lay. But Kinder resigned when Lay decided to stay on for another five-year term. Kinder s successor, Jeff Skilling, is among those at the center of the various investigations into Enron s collapse. Bush s re-election effort is one of the major gubernatorial races this fall. Former Clinton Attorney General Janet Reno is one of four Democrats seeking a chance to run against him in November. Enron s bankruptcy has reverberated in Florida, where losses in the state s $94 billion pension fund are greater than in any other state. Bush, the state treasurer and the state comptroller oversee the agency in charge of investing the state pension fund. One of about 70 money managers the state of Florida contracted with was buying Enron stock even after the Securities and Exchange Commission began investigating the energy giant and its business practices.","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinInboxEnron News"

Since some employees do not have access to voicemail, we are providing the following transcript of that message.------------------------------------------------------Voicemail Transcript - Steve CooperFebruary 14, 2002Hi everybody, this is Steve Cooper.  It is February 14, so Happy Valentine s Day to everybody. I just wanted to bring everybody up to speed on a number of items - I want to make sure that I keep you all in the loop so everyone has a pretty good sense of what s going on.First of all, I want to thank a number of you for some very nice voice mails or emails.  They ve been very supportive and I thank you for that.  I do intend to get back to everybody personally -- I ve just been busy and jammed up this week, but I do want you to know I really appreciate it.  It s been a little hectic this week, so I do apologize for the delay in getting back to you.Anyway, a couple of things have happened this week and I just want to make sure everybody understands what they are.  Number one is the result of the special investigative report.  We re beginning to reshape the senior management team and as a result Rick Buy and Rick Causey s employment with the company has been terminated.  To the extent that there are any additional changes, obviously I ll keep you up to speed.We re also in the process of shrinking and reconstituting the Board.  Six directors resigned earlier this week and their resignation is effective in 30 days.  We re initiating a fairly aggressive search for some new directors, which will continue to replace some existing directors and at the end of the day the board will be reconstituted.At the Board meeting this week, I reiterated that it s my intent in working with all of you to present some restructuring proposals to the creditor s committee by the second quarter, and nothing that I see today leads me conclude that we can t make that schedule.  I continue to believe that there is a very nice re-organizable platform here, so that the company can move forward.There was some bad news with respect to Enron stock.  As far as I can tell, the claims base here - that is bank debt, bond holder debt and other unsecured creditors debt - is going to overwhelm the reorganized value of whatever platform that we move forward.  As a result, it s not probable that there will any residual value for existing shareholders.  That s not good news.  It s an unfortunate result of this problem, and I wish it was different.  But I don t want you to be misled and I don t want any of you to believe that there is value there, because I don t think there will be.  In particular I don t want you to continue to invest your earnings in Enron stock without being aware of, at least in my view, shareholder value at the end of the day.The media sometimes interprets the elimination of existing shareholder value as a sign that this is going to be a liquidation.  I don t believe that will be the case here.  I think we have a tough road to hoe.  I think that it is going to require us to rebuild credibility in this company and its management team.  None the less, I do believe that we are going to have a reorganization here, and I m absolutely committed and dedicated to making that happen.A couple of other things that I want you to be aware of:  as soon as the dust settles around the reformation of the management team, we will get out a memo as to who the new management team will be and what their roles, responsibilities are.We are continuing to shape and push forward with the creditors committee a retention and severance program, which I know is important to all of you.  As that gets cemented, I will provide you with additional updates.  And another thing, I ve asked a number of our colleagues to plan in early to mid-March, an employee meeting at one of these local hotels.  It will, more likely than not, be in the evening and it can go as late as you want it to go.  What I thought we would do is give everybody, in a plain vanilla way, a short presentation as to where we are going and how we intend to get there.  Then we will have a giant question and answer session, so that if any of you have concerns, issues, problems, or upsets, we can get it all out on the table and figure out collectively the best way to deal with these things.That s where we stand as of Valentine s Day.  Once again, I would like to thank all of those of you who have given me some real nice emails and voicemails for your support. Again, I apologize that I haven t been able to get back to you as quickly as I would like, but I promise you I will and I hope everybody has a great day.If you have any questions or issues, send me an email, give me a buzz or drop by my office.  I would be more than happy to have a chat with you.  Happy Valentine s Day.  Thanks again so much and I ll give you the next update as soon as practicably possible.","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinInboxEnron News"

Running steady state wasn t a problem but trying to meet peaks was with the 174.6 miles.  Since Planning has been guessing at what the customer wants in the way of swing capability, TW needs to nail that part down so Planning can run a GOOD analysis.  We can barely meet the 16-hour day load at 750 MMcf/d average day condition but can not at the 16-hour day at 1000 MMcf/d scenario even with fully looped pipe.  We (Planning) can run a multitude of cases that may or may not work and still may not hit the one the customer needs).  Let s get together to discuss again to make sure everyone is on the same page.

Please review and let me know if this is something you feel we need to comment on.  My opinion would be that even if it impacted our business, it would be hard to argue against renewable sources of energy.  Below is the link to the proposed rule.  Let me know what you think.

Based on the open season documents, Red Lake will interconnectwith both El Paso and TW at a minimum, with other points to be determined basedon interest. I was wondering if there had been any discussions with eitherpipeline about the impact of adding this interconnection. I know that may be a loadedquestions, but based on historic flows, in order to guarantee firmdeliveries from that receipt point, a shipper would have to move its primary receiptpoint to the Red Lake interconnection (from say San Juan or East of Thoreau areason TW) or negotiate alternate arrangements with the pipelines.

First, below is the current Bowl Championship Standings for this week...http://espn.go.com/abcsports/bcs/rankings_full/index.htmlTalk about respect for Nebraska.  Even after a 62-36 shellacking, they only fell to #4 in the BCS standings.  Below are the possibilities for each team in the top 6...http://espn.go.com/ncf/s/2001/1119/1280619.htmlSo, you would think that would mean...   if two of the teams ahead of you lose this weekend, you guys would be in the championship game.  By comparison, Texas needs both Miami and Florida to lose to make it to the game, because of strength of schedule, quality wins, etc.  So, let s take that theory one step further...1)  If both Miami and Florida lose you would think that would pit Nebraska and Texas against each other in the Rose Bowl.  Wow, a Big 12 National Championship!2)  Texas still has to beat Colorado.  If Texas loses and one of the two top teams loses, it would seem like you guys are in as well.But you know the computers will come up with some cockemamy calculation that won t make any sense.In closing, consider the following facts regarding this weekend s games...Miami could lose their last game away at dangerous Va. Tech.  A win over the  Canes would make the season for the Hokies (see Oklahoma State).  Remember that Va. Tech was a top 5 team at one point this year and they are playing at home.   Also...  Miami has lost 5 out of the last 6 to Va. Tech!Florida could lose to Tennessee -or- if they beat the  Vols, they could lose to what appears will be a very dangerous LSU team in the SEC championship.On the flip side - Tennessee could lose to Florida -or- if they beat the Gators, could end up against that same LSU team.Lastly, there is the Jekyl & Hide longhorns playing against the Jekyl & Hide buffalos.Hey...   stranger things have happened.  The possibilities are endless, as they say at 1400 Smith (at least for now).  Of course, that may be a dangerous correlation.Mark","KHYATT (Non-Privileged)Hyatt, KevinSent Items"

Sources indicate their project is still moving forward but is having \"marketing issues\".ROW - A large diameter water line that serves Palo Verde runs from West Phoenix to the nuclear plant.  One thought was to use the ROW to install the gas line and reach the new generation plants in the area.   However, AZ Public Service indicated that the water line is constantly being replaced due to corrosion and repair work may interfere with any other line in the same easement.Cost estimate - Current fully-loaded cost estimate (including interest, overheads, ROW, etc.) is $680mm based on a reduced scale project of 500,000 MMBtu/d capacity to Phoenix.  Various deal structures are being analyzed to present several pricing options to the market.  Likely minimum term will be 20 years based on the cost.Marketing -	Duke - Met 10/25.  They have a need for 40,000 - 120,000 MMBtu/d and would likely take capacity on Sun Devil at a \"competitive\" rate.  Preparing rate 	offerings for their review 11/5.	AZ Public Service -  Met 10/24.

You are receiving this email because you have previously expressed an interest in serving on the committee.  Attached below is the current subcommittee track agenda with the 4 sessions and each session s speaking topics.  The track and topics were developed over the last 3 months with various inputs from committee members and the Trade Fair Group staff.Our current challenge is finding speakers for items 1, 6, and 15 (highlighted in red).  If you move your cursor over the topic, the comment box will appear outlining in a little better detail what info we are trying to present for the conference attendees.  I am working on lining up several speakers but as of yet have only confirmed one from Calpine.  What I need each of you to do is review the agenda, think about who you may know who would be a good speaker for the topic, then call them to see if they are interested.  Speeches should last no more than 30 minutes with a Q&A period afterward.  If possible, please email or call me with your results by Friday 10/26.  Interested speakers will receive a formal invitation from the Trade Fair Group confirming their attendance.    Thanks for your help.

This list includes all power plants including coal, natural gas,  wind, etc that we have identified.  Would you mind having someone checking  off which of the power plants most likely would be directly served by  Transwestern Pipeline? If you have other affliates that will serve some of the power plants or if  you are aware of other plants, please include them. This is a part of the integrated planning we are under taking.  Our  NARG model and the Electricty Analysis Office s models are now tuned  to include power plants that maybe directly served by interstate power  lines.  We provide forecasted natual gas prices by pipeline designation to  the Electricty Analysis Office.   By having generation plants grouped by pipeline the EAO can provide back to  us natural gas demand for electricity generation by intertate pipeline.    By this process the EAO gets gas prices for modeling the electricity market  and we get gas generation demand to model natual gas pipelines. We are not in a rush to get this information so take your time.  If  you need a date to shoot for then mid Novemeber, say Friday the 16th. Thanks for your help.

FR customers are allowed to schedule an =amount up to their full meter capacity as long as capacity is available. Ho=wever, FR customers pay El Paso a fixed reservation charge and  volumes exc=eeding FR quantities are billed El Paso s usage rate. FR customer loads hav=e increased rapidly in the last few years as growth in the states east of C=alifornia has surged. With these increased loads the FR customers have been= getting a tremendous deal since they pay only the usage charge on incremen=tal volumes exceeding their FR quantities. FR customers argue that they are= entitled to this benefit since they bargained for it in EL Paso s last rat=e proceeding. El Paso s last settlement was similar to TW s in that custome=rs agreed to certain benefits in exchange for paying higher rates to resolv=e capacity turnback issues. The FR customer s good deal is a problem becaus=e 1) FR customer s increased volumes have led to capacity prorations making= it more difficult for other shippers to get cheaper San Juan gas, 2) these= prorations in conjunction with the scheduling cycles make it difficult for= shippers to get scheduled, 3) El Paso has no financial incentive to expand= because the FR customers will use the capacity and pay only the usage rate=, and 4) the FR customers ability to take gas has prevented El Paso from of=fering services such as park and loan and storage service that other custom=ers want. Absent FERC action, FR customers will retain the benefits of the =settlement until El Paso s next rate case in 2006.The Commission is threatening to initiate a Section 5 proceeding to address= capacity allocation issues on El Paso and has directed Staff to convene a =technical conference next month to address these issues (see March 18, 2002= Inside FERC).

The Staff Recommendation is not yet available.SummaryAs noted in yesterday s email, Staff is recommending the following generalprinciples:-  The Commission convert El Paso s Full Requirements service (FR) toContract Demand service (CD)- Allocation of CD be based on the greater of (1) a shipper s billingdeterminants from the 1996 settlement, or (2) coincidental peak (ashipper s own usage) based on demand on Sept. 12, 2001- The Commission assign specific receipt point rights to shippers based onEl Paso s proposed 20 pooling point configuration- A technical conference be convened, that may include attendance by theCommissioners, on the Staff recommendationsBackgroundStaff recounted the issue on El Paso s system, including the question to bedecided by the Commission: has El Paso s FR service become unjust andunreasonable?  Staff believes it has, and explains that it is within theCommission s jurisdiction to allocate El Paso s capacity in order to:      (1) restore system flexibility      (2) end uncertainty (in the form of pro rata capacity cuts) of firmdelivery      (3) ensure full & fair utilization of El Paso s systemAccording to Staff s presentation, the problems on El Paso s system are dueto changes in system load since the pipeline s 1996 settlement.  A majorincrease in CD load and the sale of all unsubscribed capacity since 1996(which was nearly one half unsold at that time) has changed the operationsand capacity availability on El Paso, resulting in frequent capacityconstraints on the system.  This problem is aggravated by the settlement sresultant rate freeze, which impedes any economic incentive for El Paso toexpand or upgrade its system.Recommendations (Bob Petrocelli presenting)Staff recommends that the Commission convert FR to CD, while maintaining(1) the existing rate structure from the 1996 settlement, and 2) a smallamount of FT-2 FR contracts (for small customers, such as municipalities),with an overall cap on the rate schedule.  This will \"balance the interestsof all shippers and restore firm service on the El Paso system.\"  Also, itwill send the proper price signals for system expansions.In comments on this and related proceedings, shippers have recommended fourallocation methods for the converted CD:      (1) 1996 settlement bid determinants      (2) system peak (coincidental demand)      (3) individual peak (non-coincidental demand)      (4) some combo of the aboveStaff recommends utilizing the greater of #1 or #2 (using Sept. 12, 2001,as benchmark demand day).  This reflects current usage mitigated by thesettlement capacity contracts.Staff also recommends the Commission assign specific receipt point rights,using El Paso s proposed expanded 20 pool system [in this proposal, El Pasonarrows its current six pools in three basin areas to 20 geographic pools].As support of this recommendation, Staff noted:      (1) it is consistent with the Commission s one-time delivery pointallocation in BR/Amoco/Topock complaint case      (2) gives certainty for supply to all shippers      (3) enhances the tradeability of capacity      (4) eliminates daily pro rata curtailments in the basinCommissioners  DiscussionPat Wood:  He noted that 10-year settlements are far too prospective andwill never be approved by him.  Whether the Staff recommendation is thebest fix is the question that will be explored in the technical conference.Chairman Wood also asked how the economic incentive to expand will bedifferent -- Staff answered that in 1995 the settlement s intent was tokeep the system viable at all, and changes are needed to move to next step.Wood also noted that \"this wouldn t have happened if El Paso had compliedwith Order 636 -- it s a lesson on the power side that we not carve outexceptions.\"Nora Brownell:  Brownell asked questions about the current infrastructure,how the takeaway capacity at Topock is being handled, and if this addressesfuture capacity needs.  Staff responded that this is \"an economic fix tothe current disincentives for El Paso expansions,\" and that there areproposals out there to address future capacity and takeaway needs.Bill Massey: Stated that the current situation is \"intolerable\" and thatStaff s presentation persuaded him that their plan is reasonable because\"bold Commission action is necessary here.\"Linda Breathitt:  She asked if there are any other interstate pipelinesusing FR service, and was told no, only some intrastate municipalitiesstill utilize FR on a commodity demand basis.(See attached file: G-1March13.ppt)===================Nancy BagotManager, Govt.

Yesterday, scientists for Health Canada suggested that the results of a recent analysis revealed the presence of female hormones in beer, and suggested that men should take a look at their beer consumption.The theory is that drinking beer makes men turn into women.  To test the theory, 100 men were each fed 6 pints of beer within a one-hour period.  It was then observed that 100% of the men gained weight, talked excessively without making sense, became overly emotional, couldn t drive, failed to think rationally, argued over nothing, had to sit down to pee, couldn t perform sexually, and refused to apologize when wrong.No further testing is planned.Jeffery C.

Never take a beer to a job interview2. Always identify people in your yard before shooting at them.3. It s considered tacky to take a cooler to church.4. If you have to vacuum the bed, it is time to change the sheets.5. Even if you re certain that you are included in the will, it isstill considered rude to drive the U-Haul to the funeral home.DINING OUT:1. When decanting wine from the box, make sure that you tilt thepaper cup and pour slowly so as not to \"bruise\" the fruit of the vine.2. If drinking directly from the bottle, always hold it with your hands.ENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME:1. A centerpiece for the table should never be anything preparedby a taxidermist.2. Do not allow the dog to eat at the table, no matter how goodhis manners are.PERSONAL HYGIENE:1. While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job thatshould done in private, using one s OWN truck keys.2. Even if you live alone, deodorant is not a waste of good money.3. Use of proper toiletries can only delay bathing for a few days.4. Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no-no, as they tendto detract from a woman s jewelry and alter the taste of finger foods.DATING (Outside the Family):1. Always offer to bait your date s hook, especially on the first date.2. Be assertive, let her know you re interested: \"I ve been wanting togo out with you since I read that stuff on the bathroom wall two years ago\".3. Establish, with her parents what time, she is expected back.Some will say 10:00 PM., others might say \"Monday.\" If the latter isthe answer, it is the man s responsibility to get her to school on time.THEATER ETIQUETTE:1.

Livestock, usually, is a poor choice for a wedding gift.2. Kissing the bride for more than 5 seconds may get you shot.3. For the groom, at least, rent a tux.

I ve met with executives of Mid-American Energy in the context of doing my Fiber Links business and I didn t come away too terribly impressed.  It s undeniable that Warren Buffet and his chief lieutenant, David Sokol, both have a reputation for finding ways to make money, but this deal seems almost inexplicable when searching for a unique competency of Mid-American that would lead to increased earnings for Kern River.  Any other scuttlebutt about this deal out there in the gas world?  Jeff p.s.  While at Mojave, Rob Foss and I both worked with Bob Sluder when he was just a gas control/operations puke like the rest of us.  He s apparently done quite well at KRGT.Williams to sell Kern River for nearly $1B Beleaguered gas marketer and pipeline operator Williams said Thursday it has agreed to sell its Kern River Gas Transmission pipeline to MidAmerican Energy Holdings for nearly $1 billion. MidAmerican, a unit of investor Warren Buffet s Berkshire Hathaway, will pay Williams $450 million in cash and assume $510 million of Williams  debt in order to acquire Kern River. The deal, part of Williams  ongoing effort to strengthen its balance sheet, is set to close by March 31 assuming regulatory approvals. Williams said selling the Kern River system will save the company about $1.26 billion in capital expenses over the next 18 months. MidAmerican, meanwhile, said it will proceed with a major expansion of the pipeline, which currently has a capacity of 835,000 Mcf/day and extends 926 miles from Opal, Wyo., to California s San Joaquin Valley. Built in 1992, it is a key route for shipping Rocky Mountain gas to markets in the western United States, particularly Southern California. The expansion project, due to be completed in May 2003, will more than double the pipeline s capacity to 1.7 Bcf/day, according to a filing Williams submitted to FERC in August. The value of the pipeline once it is expanded will exceed $2 billion, MidAmerican said in a release. \"We are extremely pleased to be acquiring the Kern River Gas Transmission, which we view as one of the finest natural gas pipeline assets in North America,\" said David Sokol, MidAmerican s chairman and CEO. Upon completion of the sale, Kern River will become a subsidiary of MidAmerican. Bob Sluder, senior vice president and general man-ager of Williams  Kern River and Northwest systems, will become president of the new MidAmerican subsidiary. As for Williams, \"We are taking this decisive step to strengthen our balance sheet to meet the more conservative requirements of the rating agencies, which now require com-panies like Williams to reduce debt and increase cash flow to maintain an investment-grade credit rating,\" President and CEO Steve Malcolm said. \"The sale of our Kern River sys-tem is an important building block in achieving the financial flexibility to expand our busi-nesses now and in the future.\" Williams has been under pressure from investors and rating agencies since the Tulsa-based company delayed the release of its 2001 earnings to iron out debt issues related to the troubled Williams Communications Group subsidiary, which it spun off last year. Ear-lier this week, Williams said it had reached a deal with investors to refinance $1.4 billion of WGC-related debt (GD 3/5). Williams  stock price has taken a beating due to the WGC debt issues as well as the heightened scrutiny of U.S. energy merchant companies in the wake of Enron s bankrupt-cy in December (GD 12/4). In releasing its earnings Thursday, Williams reported a 2001 net loss of $477.7 mil-lion, or 95?/share, compared with net earnings of $524.3 million or $1.17/share in 2000. The 2001 loss includes pre-tax charges of $2.05 billion relating to WGC. WGC said income from continuing operations for 2001 was $835.4 million, compared with $965.4 million a year earlier. The total WCG-related charges of $2.05 billion repre-sents 80% of the total WCG-related guarantees and payment obligations, and the deferred payment for services provided to WCG, Williams said. Also Thursday, Williams said it will raise $275 million through the sale of 9.875% cumu-lative convertible preferred stock to MEHC Investment, a subsidiary of MidAmerican Energy Holdings. MEHC will acquire 1.46 million shares of the security at a price of $187.50/share, with each share of the security convertible into 10 shares of Williams  stock. The deal is expect-ed to close by March 31 and goes hand in hand with the Kern River transaction. MidAmerican, headquartered in Des Moines, Iowa, is a privately owned energy provider with 10,000 employees. It provides gas and power to approximately 5 million customers. Jeffery C.

If the Kern volume of 700,000 (out of 900,000 capacity) doesn t go to Calif end-users, I think Mojave will have a somewhat stranded segment from Cal border to the Kern interconnect.

The chicken was faced withsignificant challenges to create and develop the competencies required forthe newly competitive market.  Andersen Consulting, in a partneringrelationship with the client, helped the chicken by rethinking its physicaldistribution strategy and implementation processes. Using the PoultryIntegration Model(PIM),Andersen helped the chicken use its skills, methodologies, knowledge,capital and experiences to align the chicken s people, processes andtechnology in support of its overall strategy within a Program Managementframework.Andersen Consulting convened a diverse cross-spectrum of road analysts andbest chickens along with Anderson consultants with deep skills in thetransportation industry to engage in a two-day itinerary of meetings inorder to leverage their personal knowledge capital, both tacit and explicit,and to enable them to synergize with each other in order to achieve theimplicit goals of delivering and successfully architecting and implementingan enterprise-wide value framework across the continuum of poultrycross-median processes. The meeting was held in a park-like setting,enabling and creating an impactful environment which was strategicallybased, industry-focused, and built upon a consistent, clear and unifiedmarket message and aligned with the chicken s mission,vision, and corevalues.  This was conducive towards the creation of a total businessintegration solution.

The Huskers will feature a different look this coming season. No, Nebraska isn t switching to a pass-oriented attack. The Huskers, however, are in the midst of a significant change in uniform style. Although the details have yet to be finalized, the planned modifications will be the most extreme in several years. \"It ll be the most significant change since I ve been here,\" said Nebraska assistant equipment manager Mike Mason, who has been with the Huskers since 1988. Said Nebraska Coach Frank Solich: \"There are certainly some noticeable changes, but the players seem to like the idea. And if you look around at pro and college teams, you see some changes.\" In Nebraska s case, Mason said, the most significant modifications will be in its road uniforms. The Huskers will wear white jerseys with a red strip around the collar and a red spandex insert - or gusset - down the sides. Mason said adidas - which has had a partnership with Nebraska to provide the Huskers with uniforms, shoes, etc., since the mid-1990s - would prefer the Huskers wear white pants with a 4-inch red stripe down the sides for both home and away contests (NU typically wears white pants with red jerseys at home and red pants with white jerseys on the road). But several players, Mason said, have expressed interest in wearing red pants with red jerseys for home games. \"This isn t over yet,\" Mason said of the decision-making process. Some Nebraska fans may wince at the thought of a red-on-red combination. The last time the Huskers trotted onto the field at Memorial Stadium with that color scheme was in November 1986 for a game against nemesis Oklahoma. NU lost 20-17. The new home jerseys would be red with white piping down both sides of the red spandex insert. Solich said any remaining changes will probably be minor and will be subject to a vote of the team s Unity Council, made up of representatives from each position. Examples of the new uniforms are hanging in Nebraska s equipment room near the Husker locker room at Memorial Stadium. Because they re not the final versions, Solich requested they not be photographed. Solich said adidas representatives approached Husker officials in December about possible alterations, as is the case most every year. Although Solich discussed the changes with his assistant coaches, he mostly left the style decisions to the players, he said. \"It ll certainly be different, but the colors will still be red and white - there will be no third color - and there will be no change whatsoever in the helmets,\" said Solich, who last season guided Nebraska to an 11-2 record in his fourth season as head coach. \"Some things we just won t mess with.\" Pat Logsdon, Nebraska s director of football operations, likes the new uniforms. \"I think they re nice-looking, and the guys love them,\" she said. Mason, though, was less enthusiastic. \"I m not sure the fans will like it,\" he said. \"I don t necessarily like it.\" Added Solich, \"Some fans don t ever want any change. Some do.\" The planned changes might come as a surprise to some fans, considering the importance Nebraska typically places on tradition. The new uniforms would be a departure from the simplicity in dress exhibited by such storied programs as Penn State, Notre Dame, Oklahoma and Alabama, to name a few. \"I think the uniforms we had were fine,\" Solich said. \"I think our coaches felt that way, too. But you always want to be open to change, especially if the players feel like they d like to make a change - as long as it doesn t totally back away from Nebraska s tradition.\"Mark McConnellTranswestern Pipeline Company713-345-7896   office713-822-4862   cell713-646-2551   faxmark.mcconnell@enron.com","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinSent Items"

The project, to be constructed in two 500-megawatt phases, is= a water-cooled power plant using a maximum of 6,000 acre-feet of groundwat=er per year when both units are operating continuously at full output. Sout=hWestern Power Group II is the project developer. The approval requires Sou=thWestern to install solar technology when they begin building the second p=ower block. This is the first merchant power plant that is required to inco=rporate solar technology as a core part of the total project. Merchant powe=r plants supply power to the wholesale market as opposed to power plants bu=ilt by a utility with the primary objective of serving its own customers. D=uring Tuesday s meeting, the Commission accepted the 22 restrictions placed= on the project by the Arizona Power Plant and Transmission Line Siting Com=mittee. After hearing from several representatives of the Bowie and Willcox= communities, the Commissioners approved an amendment offered by Commission=er Spitzer. The Spitzer amendment specifically addresses concerns by nearby= pistachio farmers that groundwater pumping could affect the surrounding wa=ter table. Summary of the Spitzer Amendment: The amendment requires SouthWe=stern Power Group II to establish and pay for a groundwater monitoring prog=ram that meets Arizona Department of Water Resources criteria. Once the pro=ject is operating, the SouthWestern will have to establish and make annual =contributions of $100,000 to a Groundwater Impact Mitigation Fund until the= fund reaches a balance of $500,000. Any business or individual who can pro=ve, through successful arbitration, that groundwater pumping has caused pro=perty or economic damage will be able to submit a claim for reimbursement. =SouthWestern will be required to maintain a total balance of $500,000 in th=e fund. Status reports on the program are to be filed with the Town of Bowi=e, the Pistachio Pass Irrigation District and the Cochise County Board of S=upervisors. The Groundwater Impact Mitigation Fund must be maintained for t=hree years after the plant ceases operation and is decommissioned. Commissi=oner Marc Spitzer said the amendment was prudent considering that the lasti=ng impact of the power project. \"I proposed this amendment to answer the co=ncerns of the pistachio farmers and the irrigation district,\" Commissioner =Marc Spitzer said. \"Although we heard testimony that the power plant s grou=ndwater needs would be less than if the land were farmed, I don t think you= can be too careful. We re making decisions that could affect an economical=ly depressed area for generations to come.\" Other Environmental Conditions:= Twenty-two conditions were imposed by the Arizona Power Plant and Transmis=sion Line Siting Committee. They include: ? Establishment of a monitoring p=roject and mitigation fund for ground subsidence and earth fissure monitori=ng. Subsidence is a potential side effect of groundwater pumping. Cracks, f=issures or dips can form in the surface of the earth because the water deep= underground that provided physical support is no longer there. ? Contribut=ions to the Bowie Fire District to enable it to acquire an additional emerg=ency services vehicle as well as funding of emergency response and hazardou=s materials training for firefighters. ? Making arrangements with local law= enforcement and the Cochise County Sheriff because the project will involv=e an increase in traffic and may result in the need for emergency responses= by local law enforcement. This was an amendment sponsored by Commissioner =Jim Irvin. ? Prior to construction of the facility, SouthWestern must provi=de the Commission with a technical study showing that sufficient transmissi=on capacity exists to accommodate the output of the plant and the effect of= its output on reliable operation of the electric grid. ? Conditions requir=ing compliance with air and water quality standards imposed by the Arizona =Department of Environmental Quality and the Arizona Department of Water Res=ources. Additionally, the applicant will have to participate in and comply =with all standards for safe, reliable power delivery. \"I was pleased to sup=port this project, in part because it includes solar technology as a key co=mponent of the whole project. The level of support from the local community= was also impressive. Les Thompson, Chairman of the Cochise County Board of= Supervisors indicated that Bowie has one of the highest tax rates of any A=rizona community,\" Chairman Bill Mundell explained. \"The residents and busi=ness people were very excited about the tax and economic development benefi=ts of having the power plant in their community. Additionally, the project =will bring several hundred construction jobs to Bowie and Willcox and, ulti=mately, the 30 or 40 people needed to run the plant.\" Commissioner Irvin vo=ted in favor of the project, saying: \"I do believe the need for this projec=t was established in the record. Further, I believe the project is in the p=ublic interest and meets the balancing test.\" He was referring to the sitin=g statute that requires the Commission \"to balance, in the broad public int=erest, the need for an adequate, economical and reliable supply of electric= power with the desire to minimize the effect thereof on the environment an=d ecology of this state.\" (Arizona Revised Statutes ? 40-360.07, subsection= B.)

However,?	Current Sun Devil facility design and cost estimates are based upon a 24hr MDQ to match with existing TW Mainline services.?	Additional facilities will be required to accommodate 24hr ratable nominations at shipper receipt points.?	Minimum delivery pressures of 500-600 psi should not be an issue for current Sun Devil scope (at 24hr MDQ).  We will run transient modeling to confirm.?	If requested, we can re-design and re-estimate Sun Devil at a 16hr MDQ, 24hr ratable noms at receipt points and minimum delivery pressure obligations (with Liquidated Damages or not), but it will be enormously more expensive than the current proposed Sun Devil project.?	Notwithstanding the engineering required to provide these types of services, there may be issues with existing certificates, tariffs, customers etc. due to the fact that Sun Devil gas will run in the same pipeline facilities along with existing Transwestern services.  But I m not much of an authority in that area.?

The pricing and term were well received.  We have forwarded to Panda an outline of the credit terms TW will need as well as supply contacts and points available to them in the San Juan basin.  We are also evaluating a reverse-tilt transport offer to provide them with a lower rate in the early years, but the rate may not be enough to provide adequate coverage ratios for the pipeline project.--	Arizona Public Service - APS responded this week to our latest offer.  Their concerns were (1) TW credit in the face of the current Enron bankruptcy, and (2) our volume offer of 200,000/day in light of the current El Paso full requirements debate.  As for credit, we forwarded to APS the current update on TW s efforts with the various rating agencies and our timeline for getting a new rating established.  For volume, APS may be willing to sign up for less volume and forgo the \"out\" clause, but this puts more of the early development risk on TW for capital required to file the FERC application.--	Project Engineering - with Doug Cebryk s resignation, the Sun Devil project has been forwarded to Arnold Eisenstein.","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinSent Items"

Their strategic advantage seems to be accessing cheaper Rockies gas via Kern River and putting it into storage for later delivery to California markets.  One partner, SRP, is banking on getting a firm backhaul on El Paso to serve their Phoenix requirements.  Unless someone significantly expands the California infrastructure and interstate delivery points, the only beneficiary of this project will be Sempra with its North Baja power plant and this is not enough to justify the storage project.--  Pataya Storage is another project soon to be announced by partners SouthWest Gas and Aquila Energy.  They plan to develop 12 Bcf of salt dome storage (in 2 phases) in the same formation as Desert Crossing.  Their plan is to tie into El Paso and TW; we have been in contact and await their response to our suggestion of incorporating a Sun Devil pipeline option.--  Our response to APS on the transport option if they reimburse TW for EIS costs is expected to go out 1/25.  We are drafting a similar offer to Panda Energy.--  Panda Energy:  The current economic conditions have struck Panda-- they have initiated a restructuring and severed some of the headquarters staff including fuel supply representatives we were negotiating with for Sun Devil.  The project now reverts back to the department VP whom we have contacted to further our negotiations. Engineering -  still waiting on the revised project cost estimate based on the reduced compressor and looping costs.  The goal is $100 million in reductions.  FERC and El Paso Full Requirements Contracts - The discussion of the Strawman settlement proposal submitted by SRP to FERC did not make it on FERC s January agenda.  At our meeting this week, APS did not put much faith in the Strawman making much forward progress.","Kevin_Hyatt_Mar2002Hyatt, KevinSent Items"

This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron s Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron s stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron s remaining management team to direct the company s ongoing operations.I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world s most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.

We also have American born inner city children as well.> However, our school is overwhelming Hispanic which at last count was 77> per cent.

Although these jitters have led to higher early-November prices, the winter market looks to be well supplied owing to the combination of milder weather, depressed demand, high storage levels, and ample production. December Henry Hub prices are expected to average $2.70 per MMBtu.* US gas storage inventories are estimated to leveled off at 3,107 billion cubic feet (Bcf) by the end of October. Without harsher weather, the year-over-year storage surplus should swell to over 770 Bcf by end-December.* December demand will be significantly lower than in 2000 due largely to the milder weather expected this year. While some industrial demand will return due to lower gas prices, overall demand should be 11 percent lower than last year.**end**Follow above URL for complete CERA Monthly Briefing (6 printed pages).E-mail Category: Monthly Briefing                                  CERA Knowledge Area(s): North American Gas*************************************************************************************************************************************************************CERAWeek February 11-15, 2002 - http://www.cera.com/ceraweek SPECIAL OFFER: Register on-line before November 30th, and a 2-Day Pass will be upgraded to a 4-Day Pass (maximum $1,800 value).

This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to thevagaries of age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires),competition (Lucent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), anddot-bomb bubbles (CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that beingan icon is risky business. The latest example is Enron, whose fall fromgrace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy.   Once considered one of the country s most innovative companies, Enronbecame a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odorof conflicts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron s strugglesdrip with schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievementswere all a mirage.   We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues underinvestigation. We agree that more transparency about potential conflictsof interest is needed. High profitability does not justify breaking thelaw or ethical norms. But no matter how the current issues resolvethemselves or what fresh revelations emerge, Enron has created anenormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value.   -- Deregulation and market competition. Enron envisioned gas andelectric power industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an openmarket of bidding by customers, and where suppliers can freely choose toenter or exit. Enron was the leader in pioneering this business.   Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S.,and is spreading to Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The winners havebeen consumers, who have paid lower prices, and investors, who have seencompetition force the power suppliers to become much more efficient. Thecontrary experience of California, the poster child of those who wouldre-regulate the power industry, is an example of not enoughderegulation.   -- Innovation and the \"de-integration\" of power contracts. Under theold regulated model of delivering gas and electricity, customers wereoffered a one-size-fits-all contract. For many customers, this systemwas inflexible and inefficient, like telling a small gardener that youcan only buy manure by the truckload. Enron pioneered contracts thatcould be tailored to the exact needs of the customer.   To do this, Enron unbundled the classic power contract into itsconstituent parts, starting with price and volume, location, time, etc.,and offered customers choices on each one. Again, consumers won. Enron sinvestors did too, because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped byinventors. Arguably, Enron is the embodiment of what economist JosephSchumpeter called the \"process of Creative Destruction.\" But creativedestroyers are not necessarily likable, pleasant folks, which may bepart of Enron s problem today.   -- Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. Enron extendedthe logic of de-integration to other industries. An integrated papercompany, for instance, owns forests, mills, pulp factories, and paperplants in what amounts to a very big bet that the paper company can runall those disparate activities better than smaller, specialized firms.Enron argued that integrated firms and industries are riddled withinefficiencies stemming from bureaucracy and the captive nature of\"customers\" and \"suppliers.\" Enron envisioned creating free markets forcomponents within the integrated chain on the bet that the free-marketterms would be better than those of the internal operations. Thedevelopment of free-market benchmarks for the terms by which divisionsof integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy for theeconomy.   -- Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulatedenvironment, natural gas would be supplied to a customer through asingle dedicated pipeline. Enron envisioned a network by which gas couldbe supplied from a number of possible sources, opening the customer tothe benefits of competition, and the supplier to the flexibility ofalternative sourcing strategies. Enron benefited from controllingswitches on the network, so that they could nimbly route the moleculesor electrons from the best source at any moment in time to the best use,and choose when and where to convert molecules to electrons. Thispolicy, picked up by others in the industry, created tremendous valuefor both customers and suppliers.   -- Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts couldeasily have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding ofthe trading risks that the firm assumed, and of very strong internalcontrols. Enron pioneered risk assessment and control systems that wejudge to be among the best anywhere. Particularly with the advent ofEnron Online, where Enron made new positions valued at over $4 billioneach day, it became essential to have up-to-the-second information oncompany-wide positions, prices and ability to deliver.   The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with tradinglosses by the firm, but with fears among trading partners about Enron sability to finance its trading activity. In a world where contracts andtrading portfolios are too complex to explain in a sound bite,counterparties look to a thick equity base for assurance. It was theerosion in equity, rather than trading risk, that destroyed the firm.   -- A culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations. Enron scorporate culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywoodstereotype of a utility company is bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal,slow, and full of excuses. And the stodgy images of a gas pipelinecompany -- Enron only 15 years ago -- is even duller and slower. Enronbecame bumptious, impatient, lean, fast, innovative, and demanding. Itbred speed and innovation by giving its professionals unusual freedom tostart new businesses, create markets, and transfer within the firm.   Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion, andan open-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm s organizationand culture was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believethe role of a large corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs.This was a lightning rod for the firm s detractors. And yet, it couldserve as a model for more hide-bound enterprises to emulate.   Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about thetransformation of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quietcorners of the business economy. It rewrote the rules of competition inalmost every area in which it did business. It thrived on volatility.   The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&Destablishment, especially given Dynegy s track record as a second moverfollowing Enron s lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult andtime-consuming antitrust review, Dynegy s greater challenge will be tofind a way to make Enron s spirit of innovation its own. Or so we allshould hope, because prosperity depends on the ability of firms toreinvent themselves and remake their industries.   ---   Messrs.

Lorna   PG&E Gas Transmission Puts New Line in Service, Files 2003 Expansion PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN) already has started deliveries through a 21-mile section of its 2002 mainline expansion project, and is making significant progress on proposed future expansions. The new 21-mile pipe section put into service last Friday increases the company s ability to deliver natural gas to western markets by 42,000 Dth/d a year earlier than expected and in time for the 2001 winter heating season. \"We applaud the efforts of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to expedite the permitting process so that some of this new capacity could be in service before the winter heating season,\" said Thomas B. King, president and COO of PG&E National Energy Group s West Region, which includes subsidiary GTN. The new 42-inch pipe is in Spokane County, WA, and Kootenai County, ID, and represents the first installation of a third pipe, known as the C line, in GTN s mainline right of way. The new pipe became operational last Friday. GTN s 2002 Expansion Project also will include new 19,500 hp compressor units at five existing stations on the GTN mainline, which will increases its capacity by 220,000 Dth/d, mainly to serve power generation projects planned by Newport Northwest LLC and Calpine. Newport is developing a 1,300 MW generating plant near Wallula, WA, and two plants of similar size at other locations in the Pacific Northwest. Calpine has several generating projects in construction or development in the Pacific Northwest and California. GTN also has filed with FERC for a certificate to build a second expansion for service commencing in the fall of 2003. The proposed 2003 expansion project would add another 143,000 Dth/d beginning in the fall of 2003, plus an additional 20,000 Dth/d of winter-only service. The 2003 expansion project calls for an additional 53 miles of new C line pipe, plus the installation of one 19,500 hp compressor unit on the mainline system. Combined, the 2002 and 2003 expansion projects would put the total GTN capacity at nearly 3,100,000 Dth/d. \"The 2002 and 2003 expansion projects will provide much-needed natural gas transmission capacity to supply electric generation projects already in construction or advanced development in California and the Pacific Northwest,\" King said. In addition, GTN is exploring the possibility of building a pipeline lateral from its mainline system near Spokane, WA, to the Interstate 5 corridor near Seattle/Tacoma. The company has been in discussions with potential shippers about the Washington lateral project since an open season was completed in June 2001.  \"There is clearly market interest in this project,\" King said. \"We have successfully completed much of the initial feasibility studies for the Washington lateral project and are ready to move to development when the market indicates it is ready.\" The GTN system went into service on Dec. 2, 1961, with initial capacity of 580,000 Dth/d. The original system, inaugurated as Pacific Gas Transmission Co., consisted of one 36-inch pipe, the A line. The mainline system grew over the last four decades, first through the addition of a second pipe, the B line, measuring 42-inches, and now with the beginning of the C line. The system includes 1,356 miles of pipeline along a 612-mile route which begins at the Idaho/British Columbia border, traversing through northern Idaho, southeastern Washington and central Oregon, and terminates at the Oregon/California border, where it interconnects with the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. pipeline system and Tuscarora Gas Transmission.","KHYATT (Non-Privileged)Hyatt, KevinDeleted Items"

The attacks on theU.S. did, however, spotlight the country s need for more domestic oil andgas reserves and a uniform national energy policy.Initially, the Bush/Cheney energy plan was bumped down on the White Houseand Capitol Hill s list of legislative priorities. But that plan, indifferent formulations, has begun to resurface, propelled by a new sense ofurgency that could turn into a crisis if retaliatory American militaryaction destabilizes an already unstable Middle East, bringing about anotheroil shock.The war against terrorism could still push energy off the political agendabecause lawmakers have no time to focus on it. But commodity indices couldend up benefiting should policy makers decide to pursue U.S. energyindependence, even though it remains unclear, as yet, how that mightultimately play out.American independents have always had an ambiguous attitude toward theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). For decades, thecartel has kept global oil prices, for the most part, high, which obviouslyhas helped U.S. producers.\"Independents have a great love-hate relationship with OPEC. When they aredoing what they are doing now-that is, keeping the price at a range whichmakes sense for them economically-it generally works out pretty well for usas well, because it s a price that keeps oil in the $20-something range,\"said Lee Fuller, vice president of government relations for the IndependentPetroleum Association of America (IPAA), the industry s Washington-basedtrade group. \"And that s about where it needs to be to have a healthydomestic industry. But when they (OPEC members) start getting into the fightthat they got into for market share in 1998 or 1999, then they have thecapability to really drive the price down.\" Read the entire story athttp://www.energyinsight.com.

But he stressed OPEC s move did notconstitute a price war. \"We are not talking about a price war. That wouldmean dumping oil. We have huge excess capacity and that we do not intend todo,\" Subih said. He added OPEC was making an \"offer that is hard to refuse\" in offering tocut 10 barrels in return for one from non-OPEC producers. \"There is no timeframe but I would say before January, we will have something developing.Already there are positive signals from non-OPEC producers.\" Subih said OPEChad been forced to act because independent producers had failed to respondto calls for voluntarily output cuts on three occasions this year when OPEChad slashed output by 3.5 million barrels per day.

We looked at the Atoka 3 piping drawings and discussed some possibilities for connecting their 12\" coming into Atoka 3 (our old 12\" Atoka Loop) to the discharge side of the station. We decided to make a quick site visit with the team for possible issues.Drawing A3-A11-19 shows a capped tee on the 12\" just downstream of the receiver line tie-in. We talked about connecting to that tee, going underground to the west, coming above ground and running south along the fence, placing some valves for scrubber installation, and turning toward the east for tie-in to the existing 8\" meter run. The upstream of the meter run (upstream of the existing shut-in valve) would need to be manifolded to allow flow from the 12\" or commoning like it is now. There is a relief valve existing at the 8\" meter run inlet, it can remain on either high or low pressure service. An additional relief valve would be needed for the other stream.Drawing A3-A11-19A shows the meter run area. The downstream meter run piping would need a tee in place of the 90 under the meter run flange. One side of the tee would go the existing valve to the suction side of the station. The other side of the tee would go a new valve and line running to the discharge side of the station. That line would go west from the meter run outlet to the fence, turn north and follow the fence to a point adjacent to an 8\" valve on drawing A3-A11-5. At the 8\" valve, the line shown as \"8\" line from meter runs\" would be cut and capped. The new line would flange to the valve. With the valve open, gas would flow through the \"8\" Crossover\" to the tie-in on the 8\" Atoka Lateral.We went to the site and all piping can be above ground per Terry Youngren except the initial take off from the 12\" tee. That would need to stay underground to the fence area to permit vehicle traffic. The piping in paragraph 2 would actually be Agave s up to the upstream flange at the new valve at the meter run. All the downstream piping would be Transwestern s. Additionally, Agave has said they would place a scrubber on order and expected a 12 -16 week delivery.Measurement and quality issues brought up by Terry:Existing 8\" meter run is secondary tube, so no quality equipment existsIt does have an operator on upstream valve for shut-inIt does have full transmitters - differential, pressure, temperatureNeed additional H2S monitor for high pressure stream. Looked at 2 stream Sulphur Smart, physically too large for building.Need H2O monitor for high pressure stream. Kahn or Meeco, Terry is checking on a new type monitor.Need 2 stream Danalyzer. Existing Chromatograph is single stream. The single could be used at new Aid St. if it is ever separated to West Texas.Need new 1/8\" sample line with shut-in solenoid for 8\" run.Need new sample probe regulator for 8\" run. Look at A+ Corp, they have one that includes a membrane filter in the probe.I have some drawings that are put together. Maybe we could get together Monday morning and hopefully explain a little better.Finally, I committed nothing to Ed. I explained that his next steps would be for Agave to contact their marketing person and let them run the project through the proper channels for estimates and evaluations. I explained that the scenarios he presented of placing however many mmcf on the discharge side, reducing the low pressure (existing Atoka 3 suction) volume and using horsepower to reduce suction pressure, and possibly placing 2 units on LEC 10\" service to allow entire Duke and Yates Sulphur Plant gas on that line would have to have someone s blessing besides mine. I also explained that some modeling would probably need to be done to check expected results. Issues like isolating 8\" Atoka Lateral from the 12\" to allow high pressure receipt to bypass dehy at Atoka 1 and still be compressed by Atoka 1 (possible and brought up by Terry), isolating 8\" from 12\" and bypassing Atoka 1 completely (brought up by Ed Perry) with enough pressure were noted and I said I would pass them along.

In summary the Order contains the following provisions:1.  Two rates were adopted.  A firm cost-based peaking rate and an interruptible peaking rate.2.  The firm cost-based peaking rate will include the following components:	a.  A monthly customer charge to collect the cost of customer-related facilities. 		Actual rate will be dependent on type of customer ranging from $800 to $19,000.	b.  A volumetric Public Purpose Program surcharge based on Commission approved rates.	c.  A monthly reservation rate calculated using the currently authorized end-use customer class rate times the MDQ.	3.  The interruptible peaking rate has been set at 150% of SoCalGas  default tariff rate at a 100% load factor.4.  Firm and inter. customers will pay a volumetric rate to collect the Interstate Transition Cost Surcharge, Sempra-wide rate charge     and any other similar types of surcharges.5.  Other provisions include: customers are subject to daily balancing, interruptible customers are not eligible for Service Interruption     Credits and the tariff will apply on a facility-by-facility basis.SoCal was ordered to submit modified cost-based tariff sheets within 10 days of the order (Due 8/12/01).

Questar is looking at alternative uses for the California portion of the approved interstate pipeline. \"We can t work with (the rate) as it is,\" said Chad Jones, a Questar spokesperson. \"It definitely doesn t go far enough to remove the obstacles in the way of developing new pipelines in Southern California. It still doesn t level the playing field. Although it is better than the current RLS (residual load service) tariff; it still punishes customers who want to take partial service from a SoCalGas competitor. \"Customers still have to pay higher interruptible penalties than in other parts of the state, and higher rates for balancing services. We re at the point where we re not going to stop trying to market capacity on Southern Trails, but we re definitely at the point where we have to consider some alternative uses for the California portion (of the 700-miles, 16-inch-diameter pipeline).\" One of the alternatives would be to operate the California part of the line as a petroleum or liquids line carrying product from the Long Beach Harbor area to existing petroleum or liquid products pipelines in and around the California-Arizona border. That s the alternative, however, Jones said, but finding a customer for a major portion of the converted pipeline s 120 MMcf/d capacity is still Questar s preference. After months of reviewing the issue and weighing alternatives, the California Public Utilities Commission last week established a new \"peaking\" or standby charge for customers taking partial service from a SoCalGas competitor, allowing those customers to pay only for the amounts of gas they use at any given time from the local gas transmission and distribution utility, SoCalGas. The CPUC tried to balance the need for the local gas utility to be made whole so added fixed costs did not have to be shifted to other customers, while trying to \"encourage and promote additional natural gas resources without encouraging cherry-picking or overbuilding,\" according to CPUC President Loretta Lynch. Questar officials said Tuesday they have pretty much exhausted their appeal resources, and they are \"not about to go head-to-head with the established big boys\" in lobbying California s governor or state legislature, Jones said. \"Thus, we re still looking for a large customer who would be willing to break the gridlock in Southern California in the name of promoting competition.\" The east-of-California portion of the Southern Trails pipeline is already fully subscribed and will start operations mid-year next year, Jones said.","KHYATT (Non-Privileged)Hyatt, KevinDeleted ItemsSo Trails"

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) rejected the utility s own proposal as \"anti-competitive.\" \"This case has been very contentious,\" said the lead commissioner assigned to the case, Richard Bilas. \"For the most part, the response to SoCal s application was negative.\" Noting active opposition from large end-users, merchant generators and interstate pipelines, Bilas said that it is difficult to find an ideal peaking rate for gas. CPUC President Loretta Lynch dropped an alternate proposal to support Bilas. Ideally, the regulators are trying to keep the utility and its captive customers whole, while not deterring the option of what they call \"economic bypass,\" said Bilas, noting that SoCalGas  proposals did not \"reflect market reality. The new rate calculation is very complex, and potential competitors have yet to comment on its impact. A number of proposed interstate pipelines are lined up at the border awaiting a decision which would make it economic for them to proceed into SoCalGas territory, including an expansion of Mojave to Sacramento, Questar Corp. s proposed Southern Trails oil-to-natural gas converted pipeline from the Four Corners area to Long Beach, and Kinder Morgan and Calpine s Sonoran pipe to San Francisco.Up to this point the utility s residual load service (RLS) charges -- which customers of other pipelines had to pay in addition to charges paid to the transporting pipelines -- made it uneconomic to sign up on other lines. Called on by the CPUC to come in with a more moderate system, SoCalGas had proposed replacing the RLS charge with a peaking charge that customers said was just as onerous. The CPUC made its decision on a revised peaking charge unanimously on a 4-0 vote, with one of the five-member body s commissioners absent. The CPUC action establishes a peaking rate for SoCalGas customers who want to take only partial service from the utility and get their baseload service from another pipeline. Customers will be required to pay a monthly demand charge, public goods charge collected on a volumetric basis (so if there is no use, there is no charge), a reservation charge with a complex formula, and an interruptible peaking rate for volumes actually received. Peaking customers will be subject to daily balancing and a credit for service interruptions of firm capacity, which will apply to both new and existing facilities. \"The new rate contrasts to the rate design in place for SoCalGas  standard full-requirements firm-load customers who pay for priority on a volumetric basis,\" Lynch said. \"We re changing the peaking rates so that customers not taking their full service from the utility will only pay for the amount of capacity they use on any given day. \"The challenge for the CPUC in this case was to establish a peaking tariff for natural gas service that fairly compensates SoCalGas for standing ready to serve the peak needs only of some customers, while those customers go off its system for their baseload needs, but also to develop a tariff that allows SoCalGas to be able to compete with some of the energy company pipelines that plan to enter into SoCal s service territory. \"We re trying to encourage and promote additional natural gas resources without encouraging cherry picking or overbuilding for which core customers would end up paying for,\" Lynch added.","KHYATT (Non-Privileged)Hyatt, KevinDeleted ItemsSo Trails"

The peaking service was introduced to replace the controversial back-up residual load service (RLS) on the SoCal Gas system. The RLS has been challenged as an \"anti-bypass\" mechanism. \"We were hoping for something less punitive, something that would encourage interstate pipeline construction, but this is more punitive. This will prevent any further investment in infrastructure,\" said Chadd Jones, spokesperson for Questar, which has an oil pipeline conversion project ready to go at the border. Jones said Questar, which has already started to convert a 16-inch oil line to natural gas outside California s border, is hoping the full CPUC will take a closer look and make some changes to the judge s decision. Otherwise, the converted Southern Trails line will have to stop at the border due to lack of customers. If the new peaking service is approved as it stands, customers of an interstate line into the state, instead of paying the RLS charge for back-up service supplied by the utility, would pay the even more onerous peaking charge. The peaking charge, added onto the charges paid for space on the interstate, makes the choice of interstate transportation prohibitive. Jones said the Southern Trails line is fully subscribed from the Four Corners area to the border, but \"no one is willing to take service on the in-state portion of the line to Long Beach, for fear of having to pay peaking rates.\" Customers have been interested, but the potential cost is prohibitive. \"It s the reason no interstate pipelines have been built into SoCal Gas  territory,\" Jones said. He noted that Pacific Gas & Electric has no back-up service charge. The only interstate to penetrate California s borders, Kern River Pipeline, delivers to Bakersfield, which is outside the SoCal Gas system. Jones said the back-up service rate is more punitive than Questar has seen anywhere else. \"Usually, if there is a peaking charge, it is based on the whole system s needs on a peak day. This is based on a single customer s peak day. It makes the rate exorbitant.\" Besides the Southern Trails project, several other proposed new interstate pipelines could be affected if the peaking service makes them uneconomic. Meanwhile, the California Energy Commission has cited the lack of in-state pipeline capacity as the major reason for natural gas price spikes at the Southern California border (see Daily GPI, June 5 <d20010605i.html>).","KHYATT (Non-Privileged)Hyatt, KevinDeleted ItemsSo Trails"

SoCalGas had proposed either a market-based or cost-based peaking rate in place of the RLS. ALJ Carol A. Brown rejected the market-based rates, saying the cost-based system \"is consistent with our policy of promoting economic bypass.\" Opponents of SoCal s RLS rate have called it an \"anti-bypass\" tariff, saying it effectively kept new interstates out of SoCalGas territory since customers would have to pay the interstate s rates as well as SoCal s RLS charge (See Daily GPI, April 23 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010423g.html>). The judge said \"the cost-based peaking tariff should include a customer charge computed monthly, based on the higher of either the current monthly usage or the highest monthly usage over the prior 12-month period; a Public Purpose Program (PPP) charge based on the PPP rates adopted by the Commission in Resolution G-3303; a reservation charge for transportation using noncore coincident peak demand for the calculation of the demand charge; and an Interstate Transition Cost Surcharge, collected as a separate volumetric rate, to be applied to the actual recorded, monthly, throughput.\" Also the peaking tariff \"shall: (a) be a system-wide rate; (b) customers shall balance their nominations and burns daily; (c) partial bypass customers shall not be eligible for SIC credit; and (d) the tariff shall apply on a facility-by-facility basis.\" It also will be subject to review in the SoCalGas Biannual Cost Allocation Proceeding. The judge recommended that SoCalGas file for a conforming peaking tariff within 10 days of approval of the decision. The decision must be reviewed by the full CPUC.","KHYATT (Non-Privileged)Hyatt, KevinDeleted ItemsSo Trails"

Power plant developers have responded aggressively to thepower crisis in the West and the potential for power shortages in theMidwest and Northeast, according to a report, New Coal-Fired Generation: TheRace Is On, by Boulder, Colo.-based RDI Consulting.Using data compiled by RDI, a data division of Platts, the report estimatesthe U.S. will require 296,000 MW of capacity additions by 2015 to meetgrowing demand and to replace older units likely to retire. This compareswith roughly 780,000 MW of installed capacity in the U.S. today. RDI also projects that almost 60% of the required capacity will be built bythe end of 2006 and, despite extreme volatility in natural gas prices, themajority of this new capacity will be gas-fired-equaling nearly 170,000 MW.Because of that fact, for developers looking to build coal-fired plants, therace has turned into a marathon. The advantage of proposed coal-fired generation is the potential for lowdispatch costs. Hypothetical plants modeled by RDI in all areas of thecountry show new coal-fired generation can dispatch well ahead of gas-firedplants and somewhat ahead of most existing coal-fired plants. Disadvantages of new coal-fired generation are higher initial capital costsand greater risk, which means that new coal-fired plants are susceptible todepressed market prices that could result from overbuilding new capacity.Developers will have two choices in the near term if coal plants are tosucceed: wait out the surge of capacity development and be prepared to enterthe market later in the decade when the excess capacity is absorbed; orsecure long term power sales agreements and capacity contracts that willprovide enough revenue to cover the high development costs of a new coalplant.

This was done to try and guareentee that every child will be adopted and that the Enron Kids board has the funds necessary to cover the children not picked after Friday.  After three days Enron Kids have only 128 children choosen out of 468 total students in Gordon Elementary.This decision was not considered lightly, the board is very committed to this project and hopes that this reduction will allow employees to maybe adopt an additional child with this savings.  The other alturnatives were for total eleminate, or just purchase a toy and a book for each student.  Enron Kids board is hoping to make this adjustment to guarantee that the entire school is handled by the Dec 14th deadline.
